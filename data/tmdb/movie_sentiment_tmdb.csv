"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a fun ride through the iconic world of Mario. The screenplay is admittedly very bare bones, and the characters lack depth, but the film still manages to capture the essence of the beloved video game franchise. The writers do not attempt to do anything beyond create a narrative that intentionally puts our characters in worlds and areas that are instantly recognizable to the audience. This makes the film feel like a Mario game come to life so that audiences can say “that is like Mario Kart or Super Smash Bros.” The movie pacing flies at a breakneck speed, and I felt that this movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the story and characters a bit more.I was initially nervous about how the voice acting would hold up, but I was pleasantly surprised. Chris Pratt's voice as Mario is not over the top, which works well. It would have been extremely annoying to hear the super Italian Mario accent for a full hour and thirty minutes. Jack Black's portrayal of Bowser steals the show and was the best of the film. Anna Taylor Joy and Seth Rogan were good as Princess Peach and Donkey Kong, although I think Rogan may have injected a bit too much of himself in the character.The direction of the film is solid, with great action set pieces and creative camera angles that make the action feel exciting and dynamic. The animation is stunning, with the characters and world directly designed off the games, but with more polish and details than ever before. The lighting is beautiful, with the bright lights of Rainbow Road and the dark, fiery flames of Bowser standing out as highlights.Overall, The Super Mario Bros. Movie may not be the deepest or most complex film, but it is a good time for fans of the Mario franchise. The movie captures the fun and whimsy tone of the games and brings it to life on the big screen. While the comedy may not hit every mark, the voice acting, and direction make up for it. I am excited to see where this film series goes next.Score: 72%Verdict: Good",502356,TitanGusang,7.0,Positive

" Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the perfect farewell to this quirky group of rogues we never expected to love so much. Our faith in the Marvel Cinematic Universe waned throughout Phase 4 with films that felt hollow, rushed, and insincere. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 rekindled my hope as James Gunn and the cast’s love and passion for these characters shined in every moment of this beautiful, heartfelt send-off. Gunn reminded us of the magic of comic book movies when the storyteller cares more about the characters than the box office. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Karen Gillan, Dave Bautista, and the rest of the cast pour themselves into entertaining and genuine performances. This film is surprisingly emotional and had me wondering how they convinced me to care so deeply about such a zany group of goofballs, but that they did. Vol. 3 is one of the best conclusions to a film trilogy that had me leave the theater full of satisfaction and nostalgia. While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is wonderful in nearly every way, if I had a complaint, it would be the soundtrack felt forced at times rather than complimenting strong moments in the first film. The villain wasn’t exceptional but was better than the average Marvel villain, and honestly, Vol. 3 wasn’t about the villain or battles as much as it was a farewell to a family of heroes we have all come to love. This movie is well worth your time, and the fantastic effects and cinematography warrant a trip to the cinema to enjoy it to its fullest! MCU doubters need to set aside their skepticism and enjoy saying goodbye to these beloved characters with this outstanding film.",447365,mooney240,9.0,Positive
"**A heartfelt & entrancing closure to our favourite band of misfits from marvel **GOTG Vol 3 is a fantastic, emotionally immersive product from Marvel which not only made me delighted with the experience but also revived my faith in Marvel Studios. With the vibrant music from the past, hillarious chemistry between the leads , striking action set pieces packaged with an emotive backstory this one is bound to be loved and cherished to glory by all the loyal marvel fanatics. After a long time, Marvel delivers a beautiful and wholesome experience. While everyone from the cast gets their due share of high moments but this film belongs to Rocket. The true MVP of the film. The High Evolutionary's character was unforgiving and brilliant in the context of the story. The screenplay never dissapoints and keeps you engaged even with its long runtime of 150mins. An delightful film by James Gunn who finishes things off at Marvel to focus on DC's future. Overall, GOTG3 is an uproarious, emotional and probably the best marvel flicks after endgame which leaves you with smile in the end.",447365,mynameritesh,9.0,Positive
"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-is-a-satisfying-conclusion-to-gunns-trilogy/""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an emotionally powerful, tear-inducing ""farewell"" to James Gunn and his Guardians. Rocket's bittersweet storyline is the soul, heart, and engine running the best MCU film since Spider-Man: No Way Home. It's visually stunning, with exceptional VFX work. The score and soundtrack couldn't be more perfectly matched. Superb performances from the compelling protagonists and even the fun cameos. A better comedy-drama balance than its predecessor, while still offering tons of entertaining sequences. A few minor issues hold it back from standing out as ""one of the greats"", but it was hard to deliver a more satisfying conclusion to this much-beloved trilogy.

"**John Wick: Chapter 4 is at the peak of action cinema and fight choreography. What the film lacks in story is dramatically overcome with the most stunning action set pieces ever seen.**John Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance! For the entire 2.5-hour runtime, this movie transitions from weapon to weapon, set piece to set piece, and spectacle to spectacle topping anything ever seen. The fight sequences never stop, and their beauty and intricacies drop jaw while breaking jaw. From the scene with the nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if not the pinnacle, of action choreography. The cinematography creatively showcases each scene and battle, painting the action in bright colors and finding clever angles to keep the action fresh and engaging. As always, Reeves is incredible in the role, but the supporting cast of martial artists helps make this film what it is with experienced actors like Hiroyuki Sanada and Scott Adkins. But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick’s story, which disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don’t go to a John Wick movie for a deep story. We go for the martial arts and gun-fu, and John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers an unparalleled masterpiece of violence.",603692,mooney240,9.0,Positive

"John Wick: Chapter 4Screenplay: John Wick movies didn't pay much attention to the script, except for the first movie. This movie gave more importance to the script than the last 2 movies. Since the duration is long, they have processed each character beautifully. The script isn't at the forefront, though.Acting: Actors in the movie have already proven themselves. It was all very good.Music: It was nice to hear the music from the old movies too. However, there was also new music. Every music was suitable for the stage and very good.Action: Although there were exaggerated scenes about action, it was better than all the first 3 movies. In particular, there is an action scene shot from the top. That scene is one of the best I've ever seen in the cinema. You enjoy each scene of the action separately. You have trouble sitting in the chair.Movie Duration: Even though the movie is long, you never notice it. It was a very moving movie.Overall: This movie is definitely worth watching. It might be the best movie of the series.",603692,EthicalAndroid,10.0,Positive

And in the 80s it would have had more of a plot and been a lot better...... but in 2023 ""Entertaining and politics free"" makes a movie into a masterpiece.

"I don’t need to tell you that the violent action in “John Wick: Chapter 4” is over the top. If you’re aware of the popular neo-noir action thriller franchise, you know that already. If you’re a fan of the smartly dressed, ass kicking antihero known on the streets as the Baba Yaga, you aren’t going to be disappointed in this rowdy, unrestrained fourth chapter. The bar has been raised and effectively met, as this fast-paced film traverses the globe, provides a dose of pure adrenaline, and leaves the franchise’s highest body count in its wake.After being excommunicated and on the run from a network of bounty hunters, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) has had enough and just wants out of the criminal underworld forever. He tries to kill them all but in the process, discovers a path to defeating The High Table with the goal of finally securing his freedom. John visits former friends, alliances, and foes all over the world, bringing trouble to their doorstep. The lethal assassin fights his way through one by one, culminating in a final duel to the death.This is Reeves’ movie through and through, and he’s created what has arguably become one of the more iconic screen characters of the 21st century. It’s great to see old favorites like Winston (Ian McShane), Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), and Charon (Lance Reddick) return, but the addition of new characters Caine (Donnie Yen), Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson), and the brutally cruel Marquis (Bill Skarsgård) breathes fresh life into the franchise.The story is weak and the performances not much better, but none of that matters if you’re a fan of pure action and cinematic spectacle. The stunt work (which is heavily influenced by martial arts) reaches absolute perfection, will impeccably choreographed fight sequences that are fresh, inventive, and exciting. The best of the best is a thrilling shootout in the middle of busy traffic by the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It’s one of those scenes that makes you want to stand up and cheer.Director Chad Stahelski is an ex-stuntman himself, and he knows how to orchestrate exhilarating, handsome action sequences. This isn’t a film with rapid cutting where you can’t tell what is going on, and it’s a return to a classic style that should be welcomed by fans of the genre. You can clearly follow each blow to the body, every bloody gunshot to the head, and every sword through the back. Stahelski’s vision is as close to flawless as one can get, and this is a great looking movie from start to finish.Despite all of the things that are done right, the film’s excessive runtime makes it seem too indulgent. Even with the breathtaking fight choreography and stunt coordination, some of the action scenes go on so long that I started to lose interest. A few are repetitive and exhausting, but the short and well-placed breaks in the form of emotional storytelling bring a welcome respite and a bit of breathing room.“John Wick: Chapter 4” is a film that over promises yet over delivers for action fans. It’s one rousing, wild ride.**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS / WWW.SCREENZEALOTS.COM**",603692,screenzealots,8.0,Positive
"_John Wick: Chapter 4_ is explosive, nunchuck-bashing, bone-crunching cinematic ecstasy that allows action junkies to gorge on a buffet of bullet casings and broken necks.**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/03/29/john-wick-chapter-4-review-a-buffet-of-bullet-casings-and-broken-necks/",603692,ChrisSawin,8.0,Positive
"John Wick 4 is an absolute masterpiece of an action film. From start to finish, this movie delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that will leave you breathless. The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.One of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.But perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.One slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.Overall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see. It's a thrilling ride that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.Score: 93%Verdict: Excellent",603692,TitanGusang,9.0,Positive
"The John Wick franchise has now made it to its fourth and maybe final, film. The question is, is it any good?Simply put, its ""alright"". In much the same way, as its 2019 predecessor, was alright. The script in this kind of exposition driven, action fare does not, typically, change that much. A certain amount of creativity and thought, has gone into the stylised, highly choreographed action and violence.That said, after the first 30 or so minutes of unrelenting gun play/martial art, mash ups, it starts to feeling ""saturating."" I can see how the creators have tried to alleviate this feeling of repetition, by offering up differing locations, the use of exotic or special weapons but its simply, not enough. A more evolved story would have helped but regrettably, that was not on offer.In summary, by no means a poor film but not quite as remarkable, in my estimation, as some reviews would suggest. Still, a decent weekend watch, with your mates over a bag or two of chips and a few beers.",603692,MovieGuys,7.0,Positive
"**A beautiful woman doesn't mean a beautiful character**Ninehundredmillion (nearly a **billion!** obviously guarantees beautiful pictures - but does that guarantee a profound movie? No!Since _the Matrix_ Keanu Reeves was established as an action hero - yet he actually never delivered martial arts in a way professionals could relate to him in a way they can to Bruce Lee, Jason Stratham or Jackie Chan (who did perform their own stunts) could. Reeves - always somehow clumsy when fighting does kind of ""stagger"" through his shootings and the longer the movie goes on, the more disbelief has to be suspended (like when him shooting 46 shots with one round of 24 shots on the stairs up, where he conveniently kills 26 people). How many times he was run over I did not even bother to count, because it starts to become unbelievable by the third time.Would you consider Reeves to be worth $39.000 for each single word like ""yes"" or ""you"" he uttered ? I don't, because it is not his charisma which saves the movie but the never-ending shooting scenes which in the end make you go to the toilet in the midst of a scene knowing that ""_action is inaction and profound talks are rare here_"".",603692,tmdb42690476,1.0,Negative
"> he's but a ghost in search of a graveyardMarquis Vincent de GramontAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!! PEAK !!!!!!!! CINEMA !!!!!!!!It's been a strange year for franchise filmmaking so far. While the very consistent dissatisfaction towards the mediocre MCU got even worse with the release of **Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania** with that film being just flat-out boring and exhausting with the only saving grace being Kang, **Shazam: Fury of the Gods** being another one of DCEU projects which will soon cease to exist and **Scream VI** surprising literally everyone at being actually pretty fucking good even though it is the 6th film in a franchise following a near-dead sub-genre of slasher films, it has been quite a lot of misses for the franchises with only a few making above the cut. Therein comes along **John Wick: Chapter 4**, a film already set on an insane trajectory, wherein everyone’s favourite bruised protagonist has gotten to a supposedly even deeper tenth circle of hell when he tried to climb out of the ninth circle in the previous film.I was a bit, just a teeny little bit disappointed by the previous film i.e. Parabellum but, after seeing this film; it is in 100 years, the one thing that all film critics are going to agree on is that John Wick: Chapter 4 truly was peak cinema. Let’s just put all our cards on the (high) table. Yes, John Wick: Chapter 4 is 169 minutes long. Any one of its many (many) set pieces contains more action all by itself than most entire movies. This thing ain’t just a chapter. It’s a whole damn book; a glorious, nightmarish, biblical compendium which contains all manners of _**ass-kickery**_ and _**gun-fu**_. I’m just gonna come out and say it. This is the best cinematic experience I’ve had in a theatre for an action film in the last decade. This film absolutely floored me. Performances? **Peak**. Cinematography? **Double Peak**. Action Set Pieces? **Triple Peak**. Ending? **GOATED FR**.First of all, performances. If you told me 10 years ago that The Matrix films are going to remain as Keanu’s most consistent and better performances, I would’ve totally agreed with you. Cut to present day, my opinion is going to differ from yours. John Wick is officially the best and most consistent piece of his performances and this film makes that certain. Keanu is mostly silent in this film but then also you can feel everything his character is feeling at a certain moment which makes his performance all the more marvelous. He doesn’t have much dialogues in this film, probably like 15-20 lines in this film but each line is delivered in a way that John Wick (if he existed in real life) would say it. Ian McShane also gives quite a performance here. Amplifying Winston’s place as John’s father figure, he is what I would call, essentially the heart and soul of this film. Laurence Fishburne, although appears very briefly, does a good job and it’s always nice to see Neo and Morpheus just strolling around and talking. And ofcourse, I’m never going to get tired of seeing Hiroyuki Sanada in a film. He comes in, murders people left and right like a badass, and leaves like a king. The standouts to me though, are **Donnie Yen**, **Bill Skarsgård** and **Shamier Anderson**. All of these have never been introduced to the audience before this film and now that they have been, they completely steal the show. Donnie Yen essentially plays the Chinese version of daredevil who isn’t a lawyer but a hitman and doesn’t think twice before a kill. Loved him in the film and the ways Chad Stahelski (the director) uses his blindness throughout the film to show us some really interesting kills. Bill Skarsgård rises up as this franchise’s most menacing antagonist to date who will stop at nothing to get the job done. He plays a French billionaire and my god his accent is just the sexiest. The pronunciation of certain words in the French accent and his control over the table’s resources literally turned the City of Love into the City of Merciless Bloodshed. Shamier Anderson essentially plays what John Wick would’ve been in the younger days. A hitman who works for the highest payday and carries around an emotional support dog who does everything but.Now, the cinematography. This film was a visual spectacle. Everything, and I mean everything looks perfect. There isn’t a single shot in this film that feels dimly lit or out of tone. The work on display is truly fantastic here and I was just amazed at seeing the various color palettes this film uses. This film manages to be the darkest john wick film without sacrificing visual clarity. Every frame is lit up with just the perfect amount of colours suitable for setting the mood of the scene and when that transcends into a bloody action scene, the environment does nothing but enhance the hacking and slashing. I would be surprised if the academy doesn’t nominate this film for Best Production Design or Best Cinematography because _**THIS IS ART MR. WHITE!**_ (who am I kidding, this film is just going to get ignored because it’s a huge summer blockbuster).Where do I even begin with the action in this film. I was a bit worried as to how are they going to show me anything new after I’ve seen literally every possible fight scenario from the previous three films. I was so wrong. There isn’t much new substance here persay but the action here is so well-defined, so well-choreographed, so meticulously detailed, that you just forget that you’ve seen something like this before; and that is what great action films are supposed to do. Make you completely get immersed in the action and John Wick Chapter 4 doesn’t skip a beat.The Ending. Ughhhhhhh. The Ending for this film might just be a masterpiece. I am not gonna spoil it for you but trust me, when you see that ending sequence begin, you will be experiencing the greatest moments of cinematic history being unfolded. It isn’t a huge CGI bombastic action set-piece, instead, it subverts your expectations and becomes something completely different yet something very familiar. A perfect end to a perfect film.Go watch this film, you will not be disappointed.",603692,maybesarthak,10.0,Positive

"A fun one!I had a terrific time watching 'Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania' , despite hearing 'meh' things about it here and there online. It surpassed my expectations, to be honest. Great cast, entertaining action, super interesting world building (my favourite from the MCU for a while, in that regard) and the humour is good.Star of the show in my opinion is Michelle Pfeiffer. I don't recall her standing out in 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' , but here she's excellent from beginning to end. Elsewhere, Jonathan Majors is brilliant - great to see that guy all over the place recently. Paul Rudd remains a strong lead, while the likes of Michael Douglas and Kathryn Newton are positives too.Love the Quantum Realm setting. I'm nothing like an MCU nut, I'm only aware of the films, so didn't know what to expect, but the place looks fantastic - from the enviroment to the creatures; shoutout Veb. Like Pfeiffer, Corey Stoll didn't really register on my radar in prior films, but him as M.O.D.O.K. is a lot of fun.Looking at my personal MCU ranking, this goes in at no. 8 - I didn't anticipate that! A literal quick glance at the average rating on here suggests I'm in the minority but I truly found much enjoyment from this. Quite the improvement on Ant-Man 2, which is at the bottom of my aforementioned ranking.",640146,r96sk,9.0,Positive

"When it comes to their Marvel properties, there’s this slightly morbid insistence by Disney to tie every teeny tiny detail of previous movies, television shows, and character arcs together in obsessive fashion. It’s becoming such an uncontrollable urge by the studio to engage in this behavior that the cause-and-effect is resulting in disasters like “Eternals,” “Thor: Love and Thunder,” and now, “Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.”Trying too hard to force a non-story into the already lame Ant-Man mythology, the film reunites superhero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) as Ant-Man and the Wasp. The pair find themselves thrust into the dangerous Quantum Realm along with Hope’s parents Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer), along with Scott’s teenage daughter, Cassie (Kathryn Newton). As they explore the unusual terrain and alien society filled with strange creatures, Janet reveals that she didn’t quite tell the group everything about the three decades she spent trapped in the realm. Facing new dangers from supervillan Kang the Conquerer (Jonathan Majors), the family must unite to stop a worldwide disaster.Very little about this project feels like a satisfying superhero movie and instead, it’s more like an assemblage of other (and far better) science fiction films. If not for the titanic budget and big-name stars, it could almost be mistaken for a Redbox “mockbuster” of “Star Wars,” “Mad Max,” “Avatar,” and “Godzilla” combined.The film takes place extensively in the Quantum Realm, which provides an unsightly setting of muted, dark brown, washed-out visuals. It’s an ugly place, so who why would audiences want to spend time there? The Realm is a melting pot of exotic creatures and peculiar inhabitants that appear to have waltzed right out of the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine. They’re cool to look at I guess, but was the point to make the film more appealing to children, or was it Disney’s way of appeasing the animators by letting them have some fun?The first third of the film seems like it’s Janet’s show, as she keeps bringing up the fact that she has all these secrets that she won’t spill to Hope and Hank (even though they’re all stuck in the Realm together). There’s no compelling mystery nor reveal. Screenwriter Jeff Loveness is grasping at straws to craft a somewhat cohesive story while also struggling to make it fit into the MCU mythology. At some point, I wish someone would just make a damn standalone Marvel superhero movie and quit worrying about who and what goes where and how.The story is frequently erratic. There’s plenty of energetic CGI action, but there also some moments that play like a touching family drama, some that create an anti-climatic post-apocalyptic narrative, and lots of failed attempts at comic relief. The film also has recurring (and awkward) socially conscious messaging that doesn’t entirely feel out of place, but it is aggressive (there’s even a direct mention of socialism by one of the characters, which will really aggravate already-angry conservatives).The screenplay is peppered with dreadful one-liners like “it’s never too late to stop being a dick!” and “ants don’t give up!” I really, really wish I was joking about this.The remainder of the movie features a lot of talk about time, the desire to get home, and — Marvel fans, you know what’s coming — the multiverse! It’s that one little word that means endless movies, endless stories, and endless money. It’s also the easy way to guarantee that all of these films in the canon always have a cop-out to lazily excuse away any inconsistencies (not that many of us could keep up or remember anyway).Another major problem with the film is that it can only chug along on Rudd’s likeability (and the cast’s talent) for so long. It’s barely tolerable until Kang shows up, but he’s a wickedly delicious character portrayed by a terrific actor (it’s a real shame that this had to be the film for Majors’ MCU debut). In fact, the entire cast deserves better. Despite all of them turning in strong performances, they still feel mostly wasted here.“Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania” lacks the memorable spectacle that most superhero films need in order to succeed. There’s no massively rousing, crowd-pleasing moment, and it’s one of the more unremarkable entries in the MCU.**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS**",640146,screenzealots,3.0,Negative

"This one was quite good actually. Marvel is quite a bit of hit and miss lately. It all depends on whether one of the woke retards has gotten their grubby hands on the script or not.It was of course encouraging that the woke “critics” on the well known rubbish site Rotten Tomatoes declared it rotten while it got a 82% score from the actual audience. Always a good sign for a movie.The movie is a pure adventure movie meant to entertain the audience. The script is decent and, as usual with a Marvel movie, serves mainly to create a reason for doing action sequences and lots and lots of special effects.The adventure is mixed in with some humor but it is generally okay and not overdone.The scenery in the quantum world is fantastic and the creatures are great ranging from terrifying to quite fun. Bringing in Bill Murray was a nice surprise even though he was a bit of a bad guy and quite short lived.The one character I really didn’t like was Paul Rudd as the Ant-Man. His anti-hero bullshit, reluctance to fight and generally being a douche until he was forced to actually do what was right was really grating on me.Overall though this was some well spent two hours.",640146,Dark Jedi,8.0,Positive
"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-is-an-animated-work-of-art/""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the epitome of incredibly detailed, gorgeously unique, undeniably epic animation within its medium. Separately from enjoying this movie or not, any or all cinephiles should bow to the ridiculously talented artists and animators behind this pure work of art.That said, the attributes and issues are more or less the same as the original. The various animation styles are overwhelmingly stunning, but also to the point of creating confusing moments. Gwen Stacy stands out from the rest of the pack – both the character and Hailee Steinfeld's voice performance – but everyone on screen is impressively captivating. The voice cast is superb all-around.An unfinished story – remember, this is the first of two parts – about what it really means to be a hero.

"And perhaps _Beyond the Spider-Verse_ will retroactively make Across’ story more enjoyable, but for now, the franchise’s flashy visuals are fully in controls of its web-shooters.As a stand alone feature, _Across the Spider-Verse_ is groundbreaking with its half-a-dozen animation styles and plethora of Spider-Men. The Spot is an insanely cool villain, Spider-Man 2099 is an anti-hero teetering on the verge of becoming a full-time villain, and Spider-Punk oozes overall awesomeness.But with the film sitting at 162 minutes and a sequel on the way in less than a year, the story ultimately feels like it’s stretched beyond its means.**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/06/07/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review-a-stunning-labyrinthine-benchmark-for-animation/",569094,ChrisSawin,7.0,Positive
"I don't know, but in my humble opinion, the punk Spider-Man really needed to look like Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, someone from the Sex Pistols. He sort of screamed them in the way he was depicted, right down to the multi-media used around him.They really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community. I mean, throw us a bone here. He spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal.Anyway, it's not bad. Miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he's developed the moniker ""Mild Morales."" He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (Hey Marvel, you could learn a lesson here). But he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me. It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly. As far as complaints go, that's pretty bare bones.It also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider. So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned. At least I'm old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed. And I am still very upset over how Peter is portrayed, but they are slowly redeeming his character.Over-all though, it's not bad. It's better than just about all of the current Super-Hero movies and, honestly, it's probably the only cape franchise that people are still interested in... because it isn't totally political BS.",569094,GenerationofSwine,10.0,Positive
"I don’t have that much to say about “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”, the sequel to the equally terrific 2018 Oscar winning film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” except that it’s easily one of the best films of the year. It’s the type of achievement in animation that’s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it’s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults.Miles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he’s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn’s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.The plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don’t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it’s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they’re a great onscreen duo.The film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn’t one misstep to be found.The story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the type of film that proves animation isn’t just for kids, and it’s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It’s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. Go see it.By: Louisa Moore",569094,screenzealots,9.0,Positive

"""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Farrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained.

"This was an _excellent_ film that left me emotionally stretched in just the right way. It's an adult movie with childhood references (not a kids' film at all), and seems pitched at people roughly my age (Matchbox 20 referenced as a track for wooing is too close for comfort!) It _superbly_ voices the internal contradictions women need to navigate to be accepted. It works hard not to centre Ken, even while his role is a critical counterpoint, but also gives a little airtime to how much a male-dominated world makes it hard to be a man too.The writing is out of this world, the pacing is spot on, and Margot Robbie utterly _nails_ the role — especially the emotional and physical aspects of being a doll in a way that playfully nods to the many ways that children play with Barbie.It's a wonderful film that I'd encourage everyone to see. It's _hard_ to watch, as a man—feeling responsible for so many challenges women face—but Barbie doesn't judge, it voices. It's a message that informs me, helps me, as well as entertaining me, but it isn't meant for _me_; the extent to which Yvette felt seen, understood and perfectly spoken on behalf of _is_ this movie, and why it deserves all the praise it's getting.Originally posted at: https://www.byjp.me/posts/reviews/movies/barbie/",346698,jphastings,8.0,Positive

But the story is very weak -- the Gloria/Sasha tie-in felt ham-fisted and the 'bonding' Barbie has at the end with Ruth makes no sense in the context of the rest of the film. It also doesn't help that throughout the whole movie you're being hit over the head with a message that they *really* want to make sure you understand (how many times can you say 'patriarchy'?)

"The _Barbie_ movie is funny, and fun, and moved with deft pace from laughs to moments so engaging you could hear a pin drop in the theatre.Its social message should not be controversial — _Barbie_ is a _critique of power and status quo_. Its allegory in art swings at every in-power group, and gives voice to every marginalized group.There's even a point at which Barbie longs to restore the status quo in Barbieland and return to her position of privilege, and is chastised by Ken who, having reversed the roles, asks her ""how does it feel?"" (to be not seen, to not matter)._Barbie_ illustrated clearly that _the status quo hurts everyone, including those in power_ — in other words, challenging the status quo is good for men as well as woman (and insert every other power dynamic here — able-bodied as well as mobility-challenged, rich as well as poor, etc.)That its social message is controversial proves its necessity. The only way this critique on power and status quo could be misconstrued as an attack on men is if people think power and control of the status quo belong only to men — which, eureka! is precisely what this movie is speaking to.""When you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression"".",346698,DRDMovieMusings,7.0,Positive

Rise of the Beasts establishes some decent human leads that aren’t annoying while keeping the focus on the robot conflict. The voice cast was fantastic! Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime will always be the greatest of all time. Peter Dinklage’s Scourge sounds and looks vicious. Ron Perlman, Michelle Yeoh, Pete Davidson, and Cristo Fernández provide solid performances, giving their characters a little fun and even some heart. Rise of the Beasts reels the franchise back in from the outrageous goofiness of the Wahlberg entries but still has a good time recognizing its primary audience is kids and parents who grew up on the cartoon.

"**The Flash uses the vast catalog of DC history to create an experience that celebrates the past films, highlights the good of the current DC movies, and opens the door for the future.**The Flash reaches a high point on the roller coaster that is the inconsistent and directionless DC film universe. The story, the action, the laughs, and the cameos make The Flash a worthy cinematic debut for the Scarlet Speedster. The movie tone finds its influences more in the Marvel and Joss Whedon realm than the DC and Christopher Nolan universe, with humor overflowing in almost every scene of the movie. Despite the controversy, Miller’s Barry Allen is well done and entertaining, but the film is not great because of The Flash. It’s great because of all the outstanding fan service to long-time and committed DC fans. Ben Affleck’s Batman pummels thugs. Sasha Callie’s Supergirl unleashes her rage on evildoers. But the best part? Michael Keaton’s return to the cowl. His delight to once again portray the Caped Crusader is obvious, and that infectious joy makes the crowd eat up every scene he is in. The other DC cameos inspired plenty of applause from the theater and, I’m sure, will be entertaining for fans. Despite the nonstop humor in the film, Andy Muschietti creates some very emotional and moving moments that help give The Flash a more potent and satisfying ending.

"Now I know that you are not supposed to put baby in a corner, but is a microwave ok? (Mind you, I've been on enough flights lately to find that latter idea has definite merit!). Anyway, this takes a while to get going as we are introduced to ""Barry"" (Ezra Miller) and taken through the family scenario that led his mother to be slaughtered in a burglary and to his father being charged with the murder. Desperate to save his dad from the chair and and to reincarnate mom, he decides to use his great speed to take on time itself! Despite being warned against this potentially reckless action by ""Batman"" (the most fleeting of appearances from Ben Affleck) he goes for it; gets knocked out of the timeline and finds himself face to face with - himself (only much better looking with wavy hair). This isn't the only thing that's changing on the old space-time continuum and shortly after, ""General Zod"" (Michael Shannon) arrives bent on avenging the destruction of his home world of ""Krypton"" on the people of Earth. ""Barry"" has to think on his nimble feet, and try to assemble what he can of the ""Justice League"" to combat this threat. Turns out ""Bruce Wayne"" (now Michael Keaton) has rather let himself go and ""Superman"" is being held in an impenetrable metal scrotum in Siberia. Time to galvanise and get a-rescuing before his future, all of their futures, are lost. Can they all save the world? I liked this film. It's got loads of action, plenty of pith in a script that is at the more adult (without loads of expletives) end of the spectrum and Miller has the ""P"" word. Personality. They are clearly enjoying this, and there is loads of charisma emanating from both performances from a star who bucks the normal trend of being handsome but rather wooden. Miller is the former, certainly, but they bring life to the role. It's fun, and abetted by a story that has some weight and plenty of pace to it, we are taken on a series of lightly comedic adventures that make 2 hours and 20 minutes quite literally whizz by. Sasha Calle gives us some diversion from the Ezra show as Superman's cousin - no slouch in a fight either, and Keaton does fine as he rehabilitates his disillusioned ""Batman"" character using his gadgets and gizmos to great effect. It's so much better than I was expecting and I have to say that I enjoyed the quirkiness of Miller's interpretation of ""Barry"" - nowhere near as sterile and simpering as Grant Gustin's pure as the driven snow portrayal. The multiverse can keep on inventing and reinventing scenarios and the visual effects can work wonders making just about anything possible - but without strong and personable characters then I am sure I will just bore of the relentless repetition of these stories. Miller is different. Sure, we all know of their much publicised flaws, but I hope the studio look past that and commit to a sequel that allows this actor to continue to do what they do well here - and that's to entertain us.

"“The Flash” has never been one of the most exciting superheroes (here he’s aptly self-described as the “janitor of the Justice League” who always seems to be “cleaning up bat messes”), so it should be seen as an even greater accomplishment that director Andy Muschietti‘s film is as good as it is. By placing an emphasis on the smarter and more emotional side of the story rather than the visual spectacle, the movie is thematically much richer than the customary loud and dumb summer popcorn flicks to which audiences are well-accustomed.In this DC Extended Universe (DCEU) installment, worlds collide when Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) uses his superpowers to travel back in time with the goal of preventing a tragic event in the past. His attempt to change the timeline has consequences, as he alters the future and creates a reality where there’s no Superman (Sasha Calle‘s introduction as Supergirl is fun, but feels rushed) or Aquaman, Batman (Michael Keaton) is retired, and General Zod (Michael Shannon) has returned and is threatening to annihilate the universe. Without the help of his fellow heroes, Barry must use his wits to save the world and reset the timetable before it’s too late.The story goes to a place that that will make every superhero fan groan: the multiverse. Don’t panic, though, co-writers Christina Hodson and Joby Harold have actually put care thoughtful care into their clever narrative, and the idea of different timelines and realities not only make sense, they aren’t wholly ridiculous or irritating. In similar films that head into the multiverse, it more often than not feels like a lazy cop-out where every death or shocking revelation can later be explained away by shouting, “Gotcha! It was only time manipulation.” Here, there are real consequences in situations where the stakes are extremely high.Barry partnering with an alternate version of himself is a lot of fun, as is meeting DC heroes old and new. There are a lot of amusing cameos that will make fans very happy. The core of the story is a classic one, giving Barry a real motivation to go back in time to alter the past. The thought of being able to change our present by finding the ability to prevent tragedy, right wrongs, and save the people we love is one that is universal, and it works well here.While the story is engaging, the visual effects are abysmal. The CGI is cartoonish and dark, with inarticulate motion and a dreary palette of dark grays and blues. It’s a terrible looking movie, something that is amplified during the poorly executed action sequences. Things that sound good on paper end up feeling lame, including a silly intro scene of a hospital that’s raining babies. The fight choreography and stunt work is so much better than the computer animated bits.My favorite element of the movie is Miller’s lead performance. He’s tasked with playing an alternate version of himself, sharing the screen with a younger Barry for much of the movie. This isn’t an easy thing to do, and Miller excels at it. This is one of his best performances, and one that plays perfectly into his endearing awkwardness and bumbling charm. Despite Miller’s disturbing string of personal scandals, you’ll find he’s the best thing about the film (if you have the ability to separate the art from the artist).I never expected to be so emotionally invested in a summer superhero movie about a character I care so little about, but “The Flash” has a sweet and touching story that’s combined with a lot of fun surprises, bursts of corny nostalgia, and a bevy of cameos that will result in audience cheers and applause. Strangely enough, it’s one of the best film in the DCEU canon.By: Louisa Moore",298618,screenzealots,7.0,Positive
"There's some good stuff here and of course a good chunk was reminders of my childhood and fandome of Batman '89 and seeing Michael Keaton back in the role. The humor for the most part was fine but got a bit 'zany' at times, almost too goofy. I did enjoy the cameos which were amusing. It did touch me emotionally due to my personal issues going on right now.That said, this didn't completely work due to, let's say, inconsistencies in quality of the previous DCEU movies, most of them I did like but can acknowledge how the studio, in its various iterations, bungled it. And in regards to to Ezra Miller, one has to separate the artist from the art which given how much of a creep he is, is difficult to do when humor is one of the keys for the character.All in all, it was a satisfying and entertaining movie but considering that James Gunn is pretty much rebooting for a new DCU, it doesn't matter very much and I don't see myself watching again anytime soon. **3.5/5**",298618,JPV852,7.0,Positive
"**Shazam! Fury of the Gods remembered everything that made its predecessor so delightful and delivered a sequel as fun as the first!**Shazam! Fury of the Gods matches the fun of the first film while, in typical sequel fashion, increasing the action, effects, and scope of the Shazam franchise. Despite being a Shazam movie, Freddy is the primary focus of the film, which I was unsure about at first but enjoyed as the story progressed. Fury of the Gods had many more characters to juggle, leading to some of the Shazam family being sidelined and the villains being reasonably stereotypical. However, all the charm was still there, helping overshadow these flaws. Djimon Hounsou and Helen Mirren brought some maturity and class to the goofball cast, and Zachary Levi was a blast, as always.

""Billy"" (Zachary Levi/Asher Angel) and his gang of rather hapless super-heroes locally lauded as the ""Philadelphia Fiascos"" find themselves pushed to the very limits when the daughters of the legendary ""Atlas"" manage to breach a magical boundary between their world and our's and are soon on the hunt for the magical staff that ""Billy"" snapped in two at the end of the last film (remember?). The daughters are led by the menacing ""Hespera"" (Dame Helen Mirren) with her potent sidekick ""Kalypso"" (Lucy Liu) and the slightly more humane ""Anthea"" (Rachel Zegler) making up this dangerous triumvirate. What now ensues are some genuinely entertaining set piece battles that unlike so many from the MCU, are based on creatures from mythology and do not drag on interminably. Levi is as much an anti-hero as you can imagine, his tongue firmly in his cheek - though not so much as Dame Helen's - as he and his gang look hopelessly - and continuously - outgunned, outmanoeuvred and outwitted. Can they rally and save the day before carnage ensues and mankind is wiped out? Nope, not a shred of jeopardy here - but the two hours just flew by. It's fun. It's not trying to offer us any grand philosophies, or complex time-shifting science. It's a lightly comedic adventure film that rarely stops for breath, uses state of the art special effects to enhance the story rather than dominate it, and by the end I was ready to remember why I quite enjoyed the original from 2019. All of this said, I fear they will try to squeeze a third from the franchise and think that would be an error. This works because of some charismatic performances - particularly from the rather engaging Jack Dylan Grazer as the lovestruck ""Freddy""; a great big dragon and an at times quite pithy script.

"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-nolans-oppenheimer-is-a-harrowing-tale-of-one-mans-life/""Oppenheimer is a true masterclass in how to build extreme tension and suspense through fast, detailed dialogue, an insanely powerful sound production, and an equally explosive score from Ludwig Göransson. Words cannot fully describe Hoyte van Hoytema's gorgeous cinematography.It's a harrowing, disturbing, genuinely frightening story about how one man's compulsion and political power changed the world. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt shouldn't miss any awards ceremonies… they're absolutely superb, as are the rest of the exceptional actors involved in the movie.Pacing, structure, and runtime, in addition to its quasi-documentary style and its narrative complexity, make this a difficult, heavy watch that will, for sure, leave some viewers disappointed, bored, or simply tired.

"**OPPENHEIMER IS ""NOT FOR EVERYONE"" AS STATED BY CHRISTROPHER NOLAN BEFORE THE RELEASE OF THE FILM HIMSELF. ** But those who have ample knowledge of physics and chemistry, this film is a masterpiece. The film takes the viewer into the mind of the ""Father of the atomic bomb"" how he thinks, how he feels with much accuracy. Nolan beautifully explains his life both on a private and professional front. The music, the sounds with each scene are top notch. The visuals of QUANTUM PHYSICS, FISSION, NUCLEAR EXPLOSION are mind-boggling. If possible, watch it in IMAX. THE MOVIE IS FULL OF DIALOGUES, CONVERSATIONS MOVING BACK AND FORTH IN TIMELINE. It's a historical biography with fantabulous acting by C.M., E.B., R.D.J. and more. The scenes with ALBERT EINSTEIN are just wow. A plethora of scientists(BOHR, FERMI, TELLER, HEISENBERG) of the age can be seen throughout. There are no action scenes if you are in search of that. IT IS A CINEMATOGRAPHIC BRILLIANCE.

"Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that’s precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan’s three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist’s life, chronicles his development of “the gadget” and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer’s odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture’s production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering’s outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. “Oppenheimer” is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",872585,Brent_Marchant,9.0,Positive
"Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the ""Manhattan Project"" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious ""Col. Groves"" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event ""enquiries"" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch.",872585,Geronimo1967,7.0,Positive

"The intersection of innovation, science, political bureaucracy, and ethics meet in writer-director Christopher Nolan‘s “Oppenheimer,” a dark, challenging biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. This profound epic clocks in at three hours yet never feels too long, even if it’s painfully clear that Nolan is indulging himself in a passion project.During World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history.There has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that’s a far cry from what I’d call “entertaining.” It’s a great movie that’s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn’t really worth it.Nolan’s film is poignant in a way that’s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that’s plaguing society. There’s a very real moral question about humanity’s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan’s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year.Nolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer’s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover’s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended.“Oppenheimer” is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won’t be completely lost.In addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn’t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it’s refreshing to see a riveting movie that’s made for thinking audiences.",872585,screenzealots,8.0,Positive

"Evil Dead Rise puts a creative spin on the classic franchise while also remaining faithful to the core experience.The story is not overly complex and admittedly somewhat generic, as the main characters find the Book of the Dead, read it, and all hell breaks loose. But the conditions surrounding this plot are what truly set it apart. For one, the high-rise setting was brilliant and created a very claustrophobic environment that worked really well. I found the earthquake to be an original idea not only for the discovery of The Necronomicon but also for the entrapment of our main characters.Speaking of our cast, this film does a really great job of setting up these characters. I genuinely liked all of them, which made it difficult to see some of them go, unlike in Evil Dead (2013). The familiar bond between them was palpable, and this could not have been done without a fantastic cast. Alyssa Sutherland is by far my favorite Deadite in the entire franchise. Her motherly connection was haunting, her facial expressions, and mannerisms are nightmare fuel. Lily Sullivan was genuinely fantastic as a final girl. Her badass nature to defend the children is incredible, and she had some really great moments to stand out in the film. The kids overall did fine, nothing that was too amazing but nothing that took away from the film either.The direction was my favorite part of the film by far. Lee Cronin did such a fantastic job with haunting camera work with subtle tilts and use of reflections. The action was top-notch, and the practical effects were amazing. So many scenes had me physically wincing with some insanely creative violence mixed with stomach-churning blood and wound effects. It is definitely a worthy successor to Evil Dead (2013) in the gore department.Overall, this may not be the best in the franchise, but I think it is one of the most refined. The story lacks in some areas, but the direction, performances, and violence really cement this as one of the best horror films of the year.Score: 84% ✅Verdict: Great",713704,TitanGusang,8.0,Positive

"As contemporary horror films go, I’ll freely admit that this is a genre about which I couldn’t care less. I find most of these films boring, predictable, stupid and not especially scary. In fact, the only ones to which I’ll even give a second look are smart horror films (like “Get Out” (2017) or “Annihilation” (2018)) or campy romps (like “Renfield” (2023)). So the fact that I somehow managed to sit through this trash heap is quite an accomplishment. (Actually, the only reason I watched was because I was channel surfing and there was nothing else on, so I decided to give it a chance (I would have been better turning on the radio).) This pointless parade of endless blood and gore is a prime example of the decline of the mainstream movie industry (how projects like this get greenlighted is beyond me, except, of course, for the obvious box office considerations). It’s so utterly ridiculous that the picture plays like something that was made up as the crew went along. I’ll admit that there was some modestly cheeky humor here, but not enough to make it a genuine camp fest. Writer-director Lee Cronin’s latest is an assault on the art of filmmaking, the kind that should carry fines and other punishments.

"The numerous manuals on my shelves for 1st to 5e speak volumes of my familiarity with the game, as does the novels I own, and the numerous D&D computer games I've played, so I was ecstatic seeing the places, people, and creatures I know very well. I've heard others who have played the game say they wished they had done a movie about characters like Elminster, Drizzt Do'Urden, or Alias instead. While they would have been nice to see, those characters are from the lore not the game. What I was more hoping for was that the characters in this movie felt like the characters the players play, the adventures they go on, and the antics they get themselves into. This movie felt like that in spades, and it was an absolute joy to see. I watched this and was constantly reminded of the crazy things I did as a player or watched others do as their DM, and more importantly the fun we had playing the game we all loved. This is why I give it my highest recommendation to all others who have played the game, and especially to those who have not so they may see for themselves what Dungeons & Dragons is really about. 8/10",493529,Innovator,8.0,Positive
"Based on the legendary role-playing game, “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” is nothing like what I anticipated and much better than I expected. This irresistible fantasy adventure has a healthy dose of good humor, playful charm, and is easily accessible to all who love imaginary worlds filled with wizards, sorcerers, warlocks, knights, and fire-breathing dragons.Charismatic thief Edgin (Chris Pine) and his band of unlikely adventurers (including Holga (Michelle Rodriguez) the barbarian) undertake an epic heist to retrieve a lost relic and to liberate his daughter (Chloe Coleman) from Forge’s (Hugh Grant) castle. Things go dangerously awry when they run afoul of the wrong people, but the group must work together to overcome seemingly never-ending obstacles as they continue their important quest.While directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein stay true to the origins of the game, prior knowledge of Dungeons & Dragons isn’t necessary. The film explains everything you need to know, making this an action adventure that’s appropriate for everyone. It’s surprising just how accessible this movie is. You don’t have to know the rules of the game to get a real kick out of this one. I’m sure there are plenty of Easter eggs hidden around for the gamers, but it’s not so insider that the uninitiated can’t understand what’s going on. This is definitely one of the film’s greatest strengths.The story (with a script by Goldstein, Daley, and Michael Gilio) is solid too, with well-developed characters and irreverent humor that keeps the movie from becoming just another based-on-a-game throwaway. There’s a ton of heart and genuine emotion, which is elevated by the terrific cast. The actors play off each other well, giving a human element to what thankfully is not just a bunch of dumb CGI. You can feel the real connection between Edgin and Holga, best friends who always have each other’s backs, and Rodriguez and Pine’s chemistry finds the perfect groove. Grant, who is having a career resurgence lately, is as delightful as ever as the rogue Forge Fitzwilliam, as is Justice Smith as amateur sorcerer Simon and Sophia Lillis as shape shifting tiefling druid Doric. Most shocking is that Pine isn’t doing yet another version of his annoying shtick here, which in itself is a massive achievement.The pacing is brisk and the special effects are well done, even if the finale is stretched a little thin. I found it easy to become engrossed in the mythical world of D&D not only because the movie looks great visually, but the characters are appealing, too. There’s plenty to root for.Even if you think you aren’t a fan of the fantasy genre, I suggest you give “Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves” a try.

"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great movie that strikes a perfect balance between high fantasy and comedy.The screenplay for the movie was pretty average in terms of the overall plot, but the individual story beats and set pieces really carried the movie forward. What makes the screenplay stand out is the creativity behind each character, giving them interesting scenes and moments to shine. The dialogue was sharp and witty, filled with great laughs throughout. However, some of the comedy was very generic, with jokes and physical comedy that have been done a dozen times over.The performances in the film were very solid, with Chris Pine stealing the show as the lead. Pine was extremely witty and charismatic, with excellent comedic timing. Michelle Rodriguez, while playing a pretty flat character, had incredible action scenes. Rege-Jean Page was a standout in every scene he was in, with over-the-top and hilarious moments that left me in stitches. Justice Smith, who hasn't been one of my favorite actors, did well here as a great comedic character. Sophia Lillis, while not getting a ton of time to shine in terms of her acting chops, was amazing in her action set pieces, especially in the long sequence where her character shape shifts while escaping from the castle.The direction of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves was surprisingly stellar. The action was sharp and well-choreographed, with minimal cuts allowing the audience to really get a larger grasp of what was happening. The film balanced comedy and high fantasy elements really well. While the shots weren't overly creative, the movie looked fantastic with beautiful landscapes and above-average CGI.In conclusion, Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves is a great movie that exceeded my expectations.

"While Creed III may not be the best in the franchise, it brings enough creativity and passion to the table to keep the series fresh.The Rocky/Creed franchise is at its best when the villain is just as, if not more, interesting than our protagonist, and that is not more evident than in Creed III. Damien Anderson (expertly played by Jonathan Majors) is a very sympathetic antagonist that has a direct connection with Adonis Creed’s past. This connection is at the forefront of the conflict as Creed tries to reconcile with his past mistakes while also being true to his present self. This back and forth is excellently done and evolves Creed further as a boxer and a man. I really enjoyed this story overall, and while it may not be the most unique script to hit the silver screen, it does enough to differentiate itself from the rest of the Rocky universe, and I can respect that.The acting in this film is excellent, as it has been in previous Creed films. I thought that there might be a hole left by the absence of Sylvester Stallone, but I really did not notice it at all. Michael B. Jordan is able to get the best out of the entire cast, and everyone is better than ever. Tessa Thompson is fantastic; her chemistry with Jordan is incredible. The addition of their daughter creates a very wholesome family dynamic. Jonathan Majors is superb; he is intimidating, tragic, and full of emotion that the audience can genuinely resonate with. His anger is justified, and his portrayal of this angry kid who had his life taken from him is incredibly genuine. He was one of the best parts of the film.With Michael B. Jordan behind the camera, this film has the most unique cinematography in the entire series. Jordan takes some liberties with the material that came before to deliver a modern spin on the boxing genre. Where previous films tried to have a broadcast experience grounded in grit and realism, Creed III turns that on its head, delivering the most stunning action scenes I have ever seen. The anime inspiration is apparent, with slow motion used sparingly but effectively. The finale fight has some very creative choices that create an intimate connection between our two leads that is a great backdrop to not only the fight but the story as a whole.Overall, I had an excellent time watching Creed III. Michael B. Jordan had a wonderful directorial debut, creating a film that left me with a huge smile on my face.Score: 92% |Verdict: Excellent",677179,TitanGusang,9.0,Positive
"When it comes to boxing movies, it can sometimes feel like there are few stories left to be told. What works so well about “Creed III” is that instead of being a laser-focused sports story, co-writers Keenan Coogler and Zach Baylin‘s script leans heavily into a sincere family drama. It’s also a solid directorial debut from actor Michael B. Jordan, who reprises his role as the title character.Adonis Creed (Jordan) has retired from sparring in the ring. After amassing dozens of titles, he’s now a devoted husband to Bianca (Tessa Thompson) and father to Amara (Mila Davis-Kent), a loving son to Mary-Ann (Phylicia Rashad), and runs a successful boxing gym where he works with the latest and greatest talent in the sport. Things are going well until his former childhood friend Damian (Jonathan Majors) resurfaces after nearly two decades in prison, and a long-buried incident (which is eventually revealed) causes tension between them. Eager to prove himself and get the boxing career he always wanted, Damian asks Adonis if he can help get him a shot in a fight. Feeling guilty, he agrees. Damian is a skilled but dirty fighter, which creates even more problems. Things go from bad to worse, with an eventual title fight between the two men.The fight scenes are well directed and exciting, even if they are predictable. The film expects the audience to know the general rules of boxing so if you have no idea what’s an illegal or legal hit, you may be in over your head. (I have next to zero knowledge of the sport but I still enjoyed the fight scenes).The film’s strongest element is the robust character development, which has always been a huge part of the franchise. Learning the painful history between Adonis and Damian makes their narrative of friends turned adversaries even more compelling, and there are genuinely touching moments featuring Bianca, Amara, and Mary-Ann. The chemistry and talent of the cast are both terrific.That being said, there is a lot of story here. A lot. It makes much of the film feel too hurried as Jordan rushes through scene after scene. It’s good that the movie isn’t draggy, but this is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it type of project. And although the characters and their relationships are detailed, parts of the script feel hollow and of course, predictable.For the third film in a franchise, “Creed III” is far better than reasonably expected. Despite a few stumbles, the strong performances, the compelling story, and themes of perseverance and the importance of family make this one a winner.**By: Louisa Moore / SCREEN ZEALOTS**",677179,screenzealots,7.0,Positive
"When you buy a ticket for a movie like “The Pope’s Exorcist” it’s pretty clear what you’re getting into. There’s a ton of Catholic imagery like the rosary, crucifixes, holy water, church rituals, and lots of prayers, all used to fight off the demonic possession of an innocent. All of the standard elements are present here, but director Julius Avery‘s film surprisingly offers a refreshing (if somewhat routine) take on the religious horror subgenre.Elevated by a well thought-out story and an engaging performance from Russell Crowe, the film tells the story of Father Gabriele Amorth (Crowe), Chief Exorcist of the Vatican (and one of the most controversial figures in the Church’s modern era). The script is inspired by the Father’s actual files of his time spent conducting exorcisms for the Catholic Church, which is enough to make your skin crawl.The movie follows Father Amorth as he travels to Spain to investigate a young boy’s (Peter DeSouza-Feighoney) possession by a powerful demon. Aided by local priest Father Esquibel (Daniel Zovatto), Father Amorth tries to help the child before it’s too late. In the process, he uncovers a centuries-old conspiracy that the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden.It’s a really great story, and one that feels more plausible than other religious horror fantasies about supernatural possessions. (You know what I mean). There are solid scares, bloody violence, and creepy imagery that are all done quite well. It’s slightly goofy but played with sincerity, which is why the film never teeters on the edge of camp. This isn’t a case of a movie that’s so bad it’s good, it actually is good.While it may seem like there isn’t a lot here to separate the film from other exorcism stories (especially when there are several scenes of priests reciting prayers while brandishing crosses at a child who, possessed by a demon, is screaming obscenities in a growling voice), the depth of the storytelling is what makes a huge difference. Every element clicks in unison here, from the screenplay to the direction to the better than expected performances.“The Pope’s Exorcist” is the type of movie that should be forgettable, but isn’t. I actually enjoyed it because it overdelivers on what it promises, and is a lot better than you’d expect.Towards the end of the movie, I literally starting thinking, “wow, Crowe and Zovatto should star in future installments as ass-kicking priest sidekicks,” and bam! The film went ahead and set itself up for a sequel: 199 of them, to be exact.

"“Knock at the Cabin” is a suspenseful, thriller with horror elements that wastes no time in its execution. After less than five minutes, the idyllic vacation choice of Eric and Andrew, dads to Wen, is turned into a nightmare home invasion. Leonard ( Dave Bautista ) tries to engage with Wen showing gentleness and countering the stereotype his muscular size conveys. Happily catching grasshoppers together, Leonard and Wen discuss family and future ambition. However once Leonard is joined by his three other companions his insistence and subsequent forceful entry to the cabin makes his character seem far more sinister. Denial and paranoia set the tone as the four invading characters disclose their backgrounds and cult like vision that has set them on a mission to save the World from the Apocalypse. During back and forth conversations and threat of death, love and compassion strongly prevails even after some graphic killing. When faced with the reality of the home invaders reasoning for their actions, Eric and Andrew’s rising panic with each separate revelation fuels suffocating tension that continues to grow until the final moments. With very clever use of the four headless horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the persuasive nature of Leonard, eventually Eric and Andrew believe what they are being told.Throughout “Knock at the Cabin” M. Night Shyamalan’s direction keeps the audience constantly questioning. Are the events unfolding on screen actually real or just cult like paranoia twisting events to suit their agenda. With excellent performances and great use of lighting and cinematography to convey fear and rising tension, “Knock at the Cabin” is an engaging end of the World thriller.",631842,tensharpe,7.0,Positive
"Knock at the Cabin is an interesting premise that has a lot going for it in terms of atmosphere and mystique but fails to land a satisfactory ending.I was pleasantly surprised with the story structure. The movie wastes no time throwing the audience into the conflict within the opening frames of the film. This allowed for an increased focus on the main story while maintaining a decent pace. The first act of the film is great, as the audience is new to the story and the mystery is still fresh. But slowly, the plot starts to repeat the same beats resulting in a less engaging second act. As the film draws to its conclusion it’s ending is incredibly predictable which slightly worked for me but may be divisive to a general audience. I did enjoy the small flashbacks of the couple's life. It added much needed context without taking too much time away from the main story arch.The acting in the film is overall good, but there are some major characters that stand out from the rest of the cast. Dave Bautista was excellent, he had a very serious, menacing presence, but had a kind and gentle nature to him that begged the audience to trust him. This was by far one of his more complex roles in his career and I think he did a great job. Abby Quinn had probably my favorite performance of the film. Her dramatic scenes were mesmerizing and really drew me in. She had such subtle facial gestures that expressed a deep sense of fear and sadness with eyes that could tell a story by themselves. It was superb. Jonathan Groff was good, although he really seems to be playing a similar style of character to all of his previous roles. I was excited to see Rupert Grint, but we do not really get to see enough of him as he is only in the film's first act and when he is present barely talks.Cinematography was great. There were some really interesting camera angles and shots that were classic from Shyamalan. I thought he did a really good job of portraying the brutality of what was occurring without actually showing it. Having it pan away from the action or it being just out frame gave the audience what they needed to know without directly seeing it. It slightly added to the suspense of it all. Although, as a true horror fan, I would have loved to see some gore! There are some very corny sequences with terrible CGI that took me out of this movie. But with a budget of only $20m, I am not sure what more I could have asked for.Overall, there is a lot to like about Knock at the Cabin, but it is missing multiple key elements that hold it back from being a Shyamalan instant classic. Despite that, I think it was an enjoyable watch that I recommend you check out in theaters.Score: 73% |Verdict: Good",631842,TitanGusang,7.0,Positive

" Extraction 2 clearly learned some lessons from its predecessor and cranked things up to eleven, making a top-shelf action film that has me demanding more! Yes! YESsssss!!! This is what 80s action movies dreamt of being decades ago. Commando walked so Extraction 2 could soar!  The action, gunplay, grittiness, and thin plotted-ness of this movie scream 80s classic but the production quality, stub work, and cinematography are at a whole other level. The prison break sequence with the 21-minute one-shot camera move is jaw-dropping and one of the most remarkable action set pieces I have ever seen. The first Extraction was a decent movie, but Extraction 2 simplified its story and maximized what made the first one successful: the brutal action. Like the later John Wick films, Extraction 2 doubles down on being a top-notch action film, not a drama with gunplay. There is hardly any story, and the scenes that do attempt to add a little character development feel generic and bland. But thankfully, those scenes are few and far between. This movie feels like The Expendables, except with one guy, fewer jokes, and even better fight choreography! If you are a fan of explosions, combat, and scattered brain matter, look no further than Extraction 2.",697843,mooney240,8.0,Positive
"Thankfully Extraction 2 sticks to the action script.Aside from a little of the usual woke feminist fantasy nonsense, Extraction 2 offers unrelenting, expansive action, after an initial, slow start. This will never be a great movie but its fun, with lots of well choreographed fight scenes, gun play and more besides. The back story is basic but serviceable and the acting from the cast is competent. In summary, this is, for the most part, what a action flick should be, diverting, thrilling and of course, fun.",697843,MovieGuys,7.0,Positive
"This is the follow-up to the unexpected Netflix hit from 2020. Chris Hemsworth is back as the fearless mercenary, with more frantic-paced and spectacular action sequences.Director Sam Hargrave returns for the sequel. The former stunt coordinator – similar to how Chad Stahelski progressed to the director's role for the John Wick series – increases the action another notch compared to the first movie.The highlight is a 21-minute ""long take"". It has impressive choreography to make it look chaotic but it must have been very well organised, with the number of people and different weapons used throughout. There is close-quarters hand-to-hand combat, a sprawling prison-yard brawl, a decent car chase with multiple different vehicles and big crashes, and finally a sequence on a fast-moving cargo train, with helicopters and more confined fighting. Each segment would be good as a standalone action set-piece, but this is stitched together to form a high-octane breathless non-stop survival and escape sequence.The movie boasts high production values and a storyline that humanises a lot of the characters – something a lot of ""dumb"" action movies ignore. Nothing quite compares to the first act. There is a rather clinical street shoot-out which is the least creative but does get interesting when they're stuck inside the building. The intimate face-off at the end goes against the grain of a typical action movie structure and provides a decent conclusion.It's a fun movie to enjoy, with impressive and inventive sequences. If you like action movies, you'll love this. I am looking forward to what they can achieve in a third movie.",697843,trovster,7.0,Positive

"**Plane is a well-done action thriller with a solid lead and good fight sequences. Nothing more. Nothing less.**Plane is a low-budget action/survival movie that checks all the boxes and provides plenty of gritty Gun fights and brutal melee combat along the way. The film that didn’t spend much time picking a clever name also didn’t waste much time on character development. Instead, the plot is centered on Gerard Butler as he works to secure the safety and survival of a small group of passengers. Unfortunately, the island they crash-landed on is full of a bunch of pirate/terrorist types, so Butler does some shooting and punching, and choking to save the day. Plane won’t win any awards, but it is a solid action movie that I would watch again and recommend renting (probably not a whole $20 purchase to own, though) to any action fan. I’m glad it got a theatrical release so people can trust that it’s a little bigger budget and higher quality than most straight-to-stream action films.",646389,mooney240,7.0,Positive
"**Scream VI cranks up the violence, paranoia, and chaos but also enhances the character development and story, making the new directors' second entry even better than I had hoped!**I have been hyped and anxiously anticipating this movie since the final moments of finishing Scream (2022) in theaters - and it did not disappoint! The Radio Silence team (Bettinnelli-Olpin and Gillett) prove they are the perfect new shepherds of the franchise. The four young survivors take giant leaps in character development as they grapple with the trauma, fallout, and spotlight of the last film's events. Their loyalty and care for each other draw immediate similarities to Sidney, Dewey, and Gale, which quickly endear the ""Core Four"" as beloved characters you desperately want to survive. The danger, kills, and gore all have been cranked up a notch, and for the first time in the franchise, even the survivors are possible Ghostfaces. I doubt and suspect everyone while simultaneously caring for them - that is masterful writing right there! On top of all that, having another legacy character back with Kirby Reed returning was fantastic. I loved this movie, but I really missed Dewey and Sidney. I also think the main Ghostface killer is a little too over the top when revealed, which keeps Scream (1996) and Scream (2022) ahead on my list. But those are incredibly minor complaints! Scream VI is another exceptional entry in the Scream franchise, and I hope we get another one soon!",934433,mooney240,8.0,Positive
"Scream VI is bloodier and more gruesome than its predecessor, but that does not make up for an average plot and rushed first act.This movie is a tale of two halves for me. The first half was pretty messy, with a lot of new characters introduced and events taking place across multiple different locations. The New York setting created a multitude of interesting set pieces, but the spanning locations result in the movie being slightly unfocused at times. The film rushed through this introduction, which resulted in poor pacing. The second half was an intense, paranoia-inducing sequence that had me on the edge of my seat. As a whole, the movie worked well but could have been much better.The best parts about Scream VI are the characters and the action. All of our returning cast is fantastic, and their chemistry works so well together. They are so great on screen that I feel as though the film does not really need the legacy characters, as they seem somewhat unnecessary. Our new cast members do fine in their roles, but they are not nearly as interesting as our core four. But that is fine in a slasher, as their role is to be carved up by Ghostface. This film is especially brutal, with some particularly gruesome kills and fantastic effects work to show the remains of our victims. There are a few kills that were top-notch and will go down as some of my favorites in the franchise. Scream VI is the first film for me that genuinely had me stressed. There are a few scenes that just linger for a moment too long and create an unsettling feeling in me that I thought worked really well. My favorite scene was the subway sequence, as my heart was pounding for genuinely two minutes straight.Other than the rushed first act, my only complaint has to do with the ending and some of the unbelievability in terms of our cast's survival. Although I do not think the final reveal was as bad as most reviewers make it out to be, I still think it could have been slightly better. I had one killer pegged from the beginning, but the other was a surprise, so I think they did a good job keeping the audience in the dark. Our characters take quite the beating in this film, with some being stabbed nearly a dozen times and still somehow being able to survive. It isn’t a huge deal, but it did take me out of the film a bit. Also, I spent nearly ten minutes of the movie trying to figure out how the hell Kirby was alive; I could have sworn she died in Scream 4.Overall, Scream VI was a welcomed addition to the franchise, even if it was not as good as Scream (2022). I do think my expectations were a bit high from the initial reactions, which may have led me to being slightly let down.Score: 68%Verdict: Good",934433,TitanGusang,7.0,Positive

"Pretty much what I expected from the fifth installment of a franchise that ended after its second - i.e., bad. Gale Weathers makes an appearance, but the original cast is gone.At the start, the main character walks up to some guy and says 'I'm gonna taze you in the balls', and does so. Instead of spending the rest of the movie in a jail cell on sexual assault charges, and then getting sued into the ground, the film just goes on. (The victim was a white male, so modern hollywood wants you to think it's 'funny' rather than disgusting.) From that point on, the main character is in no way an innocent victim, so it's hard to care that she's being pursued by a killer. The plot is mediocre, there are no funny or cool characters that the viewer might actually care about, and the killer's identity has reached the level of 'roommate's friend's brother's dogwalker', aka 'who cares'. Very forgetable.",934433,Adson68,1.0,Negative
This review does contain spoilersSuch a disappointing movie. Adam Driver is a great actor but this movie is so incredible boring. 90% of the movie are encounters to another and then another and then another dangerous blood seeking Dino. Just when you think the story might get anywhere there is another Dino to shoot. Slowly you are realizing there is no more extra story. it is just a short journey to a top of a hill fighting Dino's. And Adam is a father of a 9 year old but then on this journey he has to do the journey with another 9 year old (which looks too old) and suddenly becomes like the dumbest not able to communicate person in the world. Such a waist of actor talent and special effects money. My guess is that the makers have cgi or vision art backgrounds because the only thing well done in this movie are the special effects.,700391,JanValk,1.0,Negative
"This film starts out with an odd premise. Putting a twist on the Planet of the Apes plot, instead of earth astronauts ending up in the past or future of this planet, the Earth is visited by space travelers from a different planet in the distant prehistoric past. (The title is not a suggested rating for reviewers, but rather how many million years ago the story takes place.) So it is odd to contemplate that the Adam Driver character speaks Engish just so we can understand him, while his co-star speaks some other language. How different the story would have been if we understood her (Koa) and not him!But I digress. So this turns in Jurassic Park without the huge body count or those magic sighing moments of viewing a herd of docile grazing Brontosauruses or triceratops. Instead the dinosaurs start out as killing threats and remain so throughout. I suppose this is also a good reason to show the movie on a streaming service rather than on a large theater screen. That sort of access might have tilted the movie away from sci-if thriller and towards mere horror.I had this weird and unrealized vision of them showing some sign of these alien visitors millions of years later along with other fossil remains, but perhaps fortunately perhaps, nothing like that developed.",700391,narrator56,7.0,Positive
"Director Guy Ritchie is no stranger to crafting exciting action films, but his latest project is quite different than his previous work. The narrative is linear, there aren’t any montages, and the story isn’t about criminals, gangsters, or Brits. Fans of Ritchie will absolutely still recognize his visual style (hello, overhead shots) and testosterone-fueled themes, but “The Covenant” is a more dramatic, mature, and restrained work from the legendary director.Set during the war in Afghanistan in 2018, the film tells the story of U.S. Army sergeant John Kinley (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his local Afghan interpreter, Ahmed (Dar Salim). Called a traitor by his people for helping the Americans, Ahmed has volunteered to seek revenge against the Taliban that killed his son. He has also been promised visas for his service so his family can flee to safety in America. After a lethal ambush in the desert, Kinley is gravely injured by enemy fire. With his platoon gone, Ahmed refuses to leave a fellow soldier behind to die, so he drags Kinley through the mountainous terrain in order to get him back to the base for medical help.The film tells the story of their 100 mile journey, but then pivots to Kinley’s return to the United States. It’s months after he gets home that Kinley learns Ahmed and his family were not given safe passage as promised and, as a way to repay the debt he owes his friend, he returns to Afghanistan to retrieve them. It won’t be easy, because Ahmed has been placed at the top of the Taliban’s most wanted hit list.It’s a meaningful story of honor and brotherhood wrapped up in an intense wartime thriller. The story is told in three major acts, from the early days Ahmed and Kinley spent chasing IEDs, to their dangerous journey, to the red tape of getting a man what he’s owed. There are plenty of thrilling acting sequences throughout, and they will keep you on the edge of your seat.Ritchie has an extraordinary sense of timing and instincts for shooting action scenes, and the brutal, graphic wartime violence puts you in the be-or-be-killed survival mind of a front line solider. The director’s visual storytelling is terrific here, as he switches between handheld shots with uneven movements to dizzying aerial shots to sweeping tracking shots seamlessly within one action scene. It creates a greater sense of immediacy and danger, expressing the gravity of the situation at hand.Some of the scenes are so distressing that I found my heart pounding throughout, and Ritchie’s use of harsh close-ups adds to the intensity. There’s a lot of cat-and-mouse content that adds to the tension, but it doesn’t feel gimmicky because this is a film that is unafraid to kill off characters at any time (so don’t get too attached to anyone).Gyllenhaal and Salim make a dynamic onscreen duo, and both men have a natural chemistry that is the highlight of the film. Salim’s performance is dynamic and genuine, and Gyllenhaal proves yet again that he’s a formidable leading man. He’s in his natural habitat here, playing a rugged everyman with a non-threatening masculinity that gives him a broad, universal appeal. The performances from the supporting cast are also top-notch.The story is one of integrity, loyalty, and respect, and these men have an incredible amount of honor. Ahmed and Kinley are forced to make tough decisions, but they never shy away from doing the right thing, even when it’s the harder option. These guys are still combat killers and trained soldiers, but their friendship takes center stage. This is such a great story of brotherhood that you’ll wish it was true (sorry folks, this is a work of fiction).The film only makes a couple of missteps, and there are two major things that bothered me. First, the alpha male dialogue among the soldiers is openly homophobic. It’s laughed off and never challenged. I found this to be a bit problematic, but the way these guys talk is also likely accurate and authentic. Second, the grand finale shootout feels a bit like military propaganda, where the brawny American saviors must step in and become the heroes. It’s a sequence that’s thrilling, but feels stuffed in as a way to appease the hyper-patriotic “U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” crowd.But here’s where it gets interesting: the film is also highly critical of the U.S. government and the heads of the military. The soldiers may have honor, but those at a higher level do not. The film offers a scathing criticism that applies to the many ways the U.S. abandons its veterans too, from dismissing allegations of sexual assault, making it difficult to obtain proper healthcare, crafting vague promises, and flat-out lying. It’s a profound theme that may be lost on the majority of audiences (but I hope not).“The Covenant” is an extremely well made wartime action film, and those looking for a thrill will find it.

"**_Not funny enough as a comedy and too silly to take serious_** In 1985, several bags of cocaine fall from a drug smuggling plane in the mountainous area of northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee. Near Blood Mountain, a mother black bear eats a lot of the cocaine and goes on a bloody spree as it menaces hikers, rangers, thugs, EMTs and cops.“Cocaine Bear” (2023) is a campy creature feature inspired by the true story directed by, of all people, Elizabeth Banks. It was Ray Liotta’s second to last movie before his death on May 26, 2022. Keri Russell is on hand as the concerned mother of a tween hiker. In real-life the black bear weighed 175 lbs, but this was changed to almost 400 lbs for the movie.The production unbelievably cost $35 million. I say “unbelievably” because this is a decidedly throwaway creature feature of the semi-goofy SyFy variety. The CGI is a little superior, but not enough to make any appreciable difference. I’m speaking as someone who enjoys some of the better SyFy flicks on occasion. A good example is “Sasquatch Mountain” (2006), aka “Devil on the Mountain,” which only cost $800,000.Except for the lush scenery (shot in Ireland, locations listed below), this is decent but generally meh. It’s not humorous enough as a comedy, but you can’t take it serious either because it’s too goofy. It doesn’t help that Keri is the only female worth mentioning (as a footnote at that).How this garnered as much attention as it did is a great mystery. “Grizzly Park” (2008) treaded similar terrain and, while far from a great movie, is more entertaining than this (at a fraction of the budget). The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot south of Dublin, Ireland, in Barnaslingan, Powerscourt and, further south, Avoca.GRADE: C-",804150,Wuchak,4.0,Negative

"Slightly forced 1980s aesthetic/nostalgia trip aside, 'Air' is quality!The 80s was before my time, so I guess I'm not best placed to talk about it, but the constant shots of 80s things with 80s music with extremely 80s enviroments did get a tiny bit tiresome to me. I recall people saying similar-ish with 'Stranger Things' season 3, though I found the mix of it there to more befitting. I'm nit-picking, I know, but it just was super noticeable to me here.Anyway, enough of that unimportant stuff. The film is great. The whole cast do terrific work, particularly Matt Damon, Viola Davis (the phone call scene between those two is excellent), Jason Bateman and Ben Affleck. I'd say the secondary portion of the almost 2hrs is the stronger, prior to that I was intrigued but not invested... by the end I was both. It's a predictable story, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.The decision to practically not have a Michael Jordan character in a movie about Michael Jordan is an interesting one. It feels a tad awkward when he is in a scene and they intentionally 'hide' him. I get why, and it mostly works, but it does feel dorky at a point or two.Overall, very good.

"In the interest of full disclosure, I’m often somewhat skeptical about films that include the word “part” in their titles; I frequently feel that such offerings have difficulty standing on their own, unable to complete their stories in a single vehicle. So, admittedly, that consideration was on my mind as I screened the first half of the final installment in this long-running action-adventure franchise. To its credit, director Christopher McQuarrie’s latest has a lot going for it – an intriguing plot with a strong cautionary tale message for us about the potential dangers of AI, an array of superbly staged action sequences, the welcome addition of some much-needed comic relief (something this series has often lacked) and a fine cast of supporting performers (especially the expanded role of Vanessa Kirby, who was woefully underused in the franchise’s previous release). However, with that said, there are some elements that could use improvement. For starters, the picture is simply too long; with a runtime of 2:43:00 (and this is just the first half of the story!), the film is definitely bloated and could stand some judicious editing, especially in the action sequences, several of which begin to try one’s patience after a while. Then there are certain aspects of the narrative that are predictable, formulaic, and, at times, implausible (particularly in the picture’s overlong final act train adventure sequence), qualities that are not as apparent (or at least better hidden) in previous outings. Finally, there are the underwhelming performances of the IMF crew (Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames). The leader of the pack (Cruise) comes across more like someone whose presence is designed largely to carry the plot rather than serve as a genuine, actively engaged protagonist, and his two colleagues are underused, seemingly playing sidekick roles rather than participating as key characters (unlike previous installments in the series). All told, this is by no means a bad picture, but it could have been better, especially with it being the series finale. It makes me wonder if the full story of “Dead Reckoning” might have been better executed in a single, slightly longer offering than as two separate feature-length releases. That might have solved the issues noted above, and it may have eliminated that nagging “part” problem I wrote about, allowing the picture to stand on its own two feet as a single vehicle. We’ll have to wait another year to see how it all plays out, but I can’t exactly say I’m holding my breath about it.",575264,Brent_Marchant,7.0,Positive
"In spite of a rather convoluted plot, fall flat comedy and a very minor dash of woke nonsense, I mostly liked Operation Fortune: Ruse De Guerre. Don't let the dash of French pretension in the title fool you, there's nothing remotely clever or sophisticated, about this flick. At heart, this is stripped down, nuts and bolts, action fare. Its pacing is decent and it has enough going on, exposition wise, to keep the viewer entertained. Exotic locations, gun fights, fist fights, car chases, pyrotechnics, it has it all, in abundance.Acting is generally reasonable. Hugh Grant does a great Michael Caine(??) impression.In summary, diverting, simple action fare, with a little unconvincing window dressing, in the form of tired comedy and a nod to a more sophisticated story line, that never arrives.

"EXT. INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF THE LOST DIALS SKULL – DAYIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is more closely related to its recent sequel than its distant cousins of the original trilogy. It attempts to take the franchise's formula and shake it up; it throws in cameos, call-backs and references but suffers the same issue every recent Lucasfilm movie has. It's another modern Disney reboot sequel with legacy characters left in the dirt, and a 'quirky & quippy' new character is presented to us. You know this character type when in the face of fear, they will make fun of the villain's Lactose Intolerance or something random because this character is flawlessly confident. They are knowledgeable on every subject relevant to the plot, smartasses because they are always correct, sassy when held hostage and always have an escape plan. This is Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridges), and she might be the only consistent character in the film. For the rest of the ensemble, Boyd Holbrooks Klaber speaks once in the movie and then chases after Jones in each scene; Mads Mikkelsens Jürgen Voller is the most forgettable antagonist of the franchise, Antonio Banderas is out of the film faster than he's in it and finally, Harrison Ford as Dr Jones is unfortunately back for what seems like a pretty good paycheck.I have nothing against the performances themselves. The cast is incredibly talented, but this skilled team cannot hide the terrible dialogue reinforcing the rather forgettable story. Ultimately, Indiana Jones has one of the greatest trilogies of films with a distance spin-off universe of sequels.

"It seems these days that it’s become all too easy to blast popular, commercial fare simply because it is popular, commercial fare. Granted, some offerings of this type genuinely deserve whatever grief they get, but others, such as the latest installment in this long-running franchise, don’t merit unfair potshots fired at them just for innately being mainstream offerings. In many ways, this is very much cut from the same cloth as its action adventure predecessors, but there are enough distinctions, new developments and lesser-known elements to keep it fresh and interesting throughout. Now, this is not to suggest that this final entry in this action adventure series is without its faults – it’s overlong, some of its action sequences could have been easily pared back (despite generally being as good as they are) and the storyline tends to sag somewhat in the middle. However, Indiana Jones has once again given us a rollicking good time with a captivating narrative, an intriguing assortment of twists and turns, and an array of colorful characters all vying for their piece of the pie (if not the entire pie itself). The film also provides fans of the franchise with deftly handled touches at achieving closure for the series, without dangling obvious or ambiguous carrots of there being more to come or any kind of impending reboot. Director James Mangold successfully puts the series to bed and tucks it in nicely while rounding off any remaining edges, something that it and its fans deserve.

"When the title card for the latest Indiana Jones movie came on the big screen I was excited to hear the famous score, see Harrison Ford don his famous fedora and intrigued to see how they would handle Indy’s age in this 40-year-old franchise.The opening encounter was very familiar, with Indy fighting Nazis during World War 2. We are introduced to the antiquity and lore that is the basis for this adventure. This start was a little jarring at first, but I was soon enthralled by the action and comedy.I enjoyed Toby Jones' brief appearance at the beginning, but the villain played by Mads Mikkelsen was severely underutilised. The runtime was a little long, with the middle feeling rather lethargic. I would have preferred a little more low-key adventuring, similar to the exploration of Archimedes's tomb, than the bigger action sequences.There was a definite nostalgia kick to the entire movie. There was a new young sidekick and old familiar faces. There was the trademark adventure, creepy crawlies and historical riddles. There were Nazis, car chases and fight scenes. There was some fun deadpan comedy. The iconic travel map made an appearance – with a couple in front pointing at the screen in excitement when it appeared. But it was hearing the score throughout that was the biggest endorphin kick. It was definitely an Indiana Jones movie.Fifteen years after the disappointing Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, this is a satisfying movie that I enjoyed. In the end, it concludes Indy’s story, while potentially passing the adventuring on to another generation.",335977,trovster,7.0,Positive
"_Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_ feels like the type of sequel that aimed to capture the magic of its predecessors, had worthwhile intentions, and a talented cast, but it just never properly materialized. The film seems to teeter on the sheer annoyance of a main character grappling with the fact that he’s now a crotchety and wrinkly senior citizen and not the young, grizzled, adventurer he used to be.With an ending that leaves the Indiana Jones character in a satisfying bookend for the franchise, hopefully _The Dial of Destiny_ is the final Indy film.

"It took me a while to work up the courage to see this. I mean, Indiana Jones was my hero as a child. When I was sick I used to watch Raiders over and over again and that was a tradition I kept up through high school.And now... Thank you Doomcock, without your intervention this movie would have been even worse. It shows, the plot is messy, the re-shoots are a little obvious story-wise as Disney did their best to attempt to avoid the fan backlash promised for when their plans were to kill Indy off and have Phoebe replace him....... and then when when they re-shoot it again because the fans didn't want to see Indiana Jones be ridiculed constantly by his female replacement in an effort to make the KK stand-in come across as better in every way... and a lot of that is still there in the final product.Like Star Wars did to Skywalker, Indiana Jones is constantly shamed by the younger more diverse version... who can't seem to decide what character she wants to be. Rogue? Scholar? Conman? Her personality changes as the script dictates, but Indiana remains pathetic... so that Strong Female Lead can look better.In the end it's a mess, and the result is that Disney killed another fan favorite Franchise. Star Wars, Willow, and now Indy. They paid out the nose for all of them and then made them worthless.There are a lot of conspiracies floating around about it, but it don't attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.",335977,GenerationofSwine,1.0,Negative
"Ironically, these tale about a mother and daughter, fails because the male characters have no depth. The villain is evil sure, but also extremely stupid and escaping from her first attempt to kill him in a very unbelievable and unexplained way.The romantic tension between Cruise and the mother also doesn't work and the age old friendship with Jons is also not given any backstory. I'm enclined to blame the casting here. Well, the story was lacking and oddly edited as well, but it may be because there wasn't much to work with. Either way, it's clear this is supposed to be about a mother/daughter relationship, but also be an action move and the director / writers / actors couldn't make it work. 3/10, 2 points cause I've seen worse, not because I can find something positive in it.",552688,vylmen,3.0,Negative
"Awkwafina should have been on the poster!=========================================Not knowing she was in this, is what probably made me resist watching Renfield right away. She is the most watchable part of the film.Maybe because the rest is not a revelation; everything that happens in the movie with Cage and Hoult, is just predictable vampire tropes—the trailer was enough for that.At any moment, it was neither horror, nor comedy. Although, at the very beginning, the recovering Dracula is convincingly threatening; but not once he 'gains full power'.The excessive, exploding blood-works would have been funny, if they were selective with it's use.

"Writer-director Wes Anderson has lost his way, and this film proves it. I realize that the auteur’s signature style of filmmaking is an acquired taste, and, to his credit, he’s made some fine pictures over the years. But this one is not among them. In fact, contrary to many of the inexplicable claims that this is his finest release, I’d contend just the opposite. It’s arguably his worst, a meandering, cryptic, unfocused piece that’s so muddled you’ll need the assistance of a search party to find your way out of it (that is, if you even care by the time the end of this overlong mess rolls around). The director appears to have become so enamored with his own eccentricity that it doesn’t even seem to matter to him whether or not viewers are on the same page as he is. Admittedly, this offering once again captures Anderson’s singularly stylish look with a stunning production design and gorgeous cinematography. But that’s all it has going for it, and that’s unfortunate given the phenomenal cast he has available to him. What’s more, despite his proficiency in creating superb visual style, he’s forgotten about pairing it with meaningful (or even interesting) substance. Its incomprehensibility and inclusion of bits that are there just for the sake of their own whimsy seriously undercut any effort to make this an intelligible work. In short, “Asteroid City” is yet another major disappointment in what is turning out to be a dreadfully dismal summer movie season. It’s likely to appeal only to diehard fans of the director (and maybe not even a lot of them this time out). If you’re on the fence about this one, consider the following two telling tipoffs: (1) when no one in the theater is laughing at what’s been billed as a comedy, that should speak volumes about it (as happened at the screening I attended); and (2) when you consider how aggressively and ubiquitously the distributors have been promoting this film in ads on TV and the internet, it’s obvious they’re trying awfully hard to peddle shabby, substandard merchandise. This is a huge waste of time and money; don’t squander yours.",747188,Brent_Marchant,2.0,Negative
"Top tongue-in-cheek directors: Wes Anderson and Wen Jiang. Asteroid City isn't my favorite Wes film, but it's surely tongue-in-cheek and pretty damn funny.This movie reminds me a little of Tennessee Williams, the all-time master of damaged and traumatized human psyches. I see this work as a treatise on human issues, especially the labels given to us by others and those we give ourselves, and how they affect one's life and relationships.The partial view of the ""Confessions of a Narcissist"" marquis that showed up in the background of the tet-a-tet between Augie and his almost-onstage-wife is a clue. The term ""narcissist"" didn't become popular psychology until the 1980s. There were other anachronisms, but this one is particularly striking in context.And what's with that song and dance number in the middle of the show? The band that showed up in this desert had no other raison d'etre!! Did Wes just reference the Time Warp from The Rocky Horror Picture Show??",747188,badelf,8.0,Positive

"Aneesh Chaganty made an immediate impact with his 2018 feature debut Searching. While the Google alumnus was not the first to use the screen life format (that is, telling a story only through what we can see on computer screens and digital devices), Chaganty certainly popularized it with a compelling story of a father looking for his missing daughter.In 2023’s Missing, Chaganty produces and gets a ‘story by’ credit but hands the screenwriting and directing to Will Merrick and Nick Johnson. This spiritual follow-up to Searching again revolves around someone who vanishes. The roles get reversed in Missing, replacing a parent who has to fumble his way around social media as the primary searcher with the very tech-savvy June Allen (Storm Reid), a teen who is looking for her missing mother, Grace (Nia Long).While Aneesh Chaganty isn’t at the helm this time around, his influence is still very apparent in Missing. We don’t see June all that often, but as in Searching, we get a sense of what the character is feeling when we watch her type a message in a chat box but doesn’t send it, letting the cursor blink for a few moments before erasing the text and typing a revised message that’s more thoughtful. Anyone who has used computers would be able to relate to moments like these where we write off the top of our heads, sometimes in a very emotional state, only to catch ourselves and think better of what we’ve said. In lieu of seeing facial expressions or hearing line readings, this approach to conveying emotion and giving insight into a character’s thoughts is one of the keys to a screen life narrative, giving the story a beating heart when it could easily lean too much into the technical side and become cold and soulless.Another wrinkle that Merrick and Johnson’s film introduces is the lack of money for the protagonist. Being a high schooler, June doesn’t have much in the way of financial resources and is entirely dependent on the money her mother left prior to going down to Colombia on vacation. This presents a challenge when the FBI’s investigation into Grace’s disappearance doesn’t make enough headway for June, forcing her to hire someone down in Colombia to help find clues.With June’s limited funds, she isn’t able to hire a private investigator and is only able to afford the services of Javier (Joaquim de Almeida), an online platform worker. The inclusion of this character grounds the story as Javier is the type of ordinary person one would expect to come across in today’s gig economy. Being a father himself, Javier connects with June, understanding her desperation to locate her missing mother. The burgeoning relationship between Javier and June is one of the highlights of this film, helping to build the emotional resonance that the story needs to keep viewers engaged.With the twists in the narrative and rock-solid performances from Reid and de Almeida, Missing is one of the rare films that manages to equal the trailblazer that came before. Merrick and Johnson’s movie doesn’t have the novelty of Searching, but their take on an online missing person search changes enough elements to make it feel fresh. This film is a great ride and anyone who enjoyed Searching should give it a look.",768362,Silverstein,8.0,Positive

"There are three things necessary to make a gay romantic comedy work: It needs to involve a readily recognizable gay relationship, it needs an undeniable sense of romance and it has to be funny. However, this heavily diluted, glacially paced piece of insipid celluloid fluff has none of the above, and it truly escapes me how many critics and viewers have found this utterly bland exercise to be heartwarming, charming and involving. In telling the somewhat far-fetched story of an alleged romance between a British prince and the son of an American president who start out as comically exaggerated adversaries but end up supposedly finding true love with one another, writer-director Matthew López subjects his audiences to an unconvincing relationship wholly lacking in chemistry and stemming from an improbable courtship, much of which arises from a string of all-too-convenient, less-than-discreet engagements that are otherwise supposedly impossible to arrange and coordinate. What’s more, the film’s humor is virtually nonexistent and incorporates none of the edginess generally associated with gay comedies. In fact, it’s so dull and so safe that it makes most Hallmark Channel movies seem downright risqué by comparison. To its credit, the picture makes some modestly eloquent statements about LGBTQ+ equality (even if they’re nothing we haven’t already heard many times before), and it features a fine supporting performance by Sarah Shahi as a smart-mouthed, fast-talking presidential aide (arguably the only genuinely funny element in the film), but it misses the mark on so many other fronts that it’s hard to believe this project ever got green-lighted. It’s a shame that the door opened by “Bros” (2022) to make gay romcoms a more viable cinematic genre has been set back by this underwhelming effort. It’s also equally disappointing that an organization like Amazon Studios – one known for generally doing solid work – could let something as sub-par as this out into the movie marketplace. Let’s hope moviegoers can put this one quickly behind them and see the foregoing issues soon fixed going forward.",930094,Brent_Marchant,3.0,Negative
"""You People"" is a culture/race clash comedy that revolves around a mixed-race couple and their respective parents. Despite the cast, which includes several SNL alumni, having the talent to deliver comedic performances, the film falls short in delivering engaging and meaningful humor. The presentation style reminiscent of a ""GTA 5"" cutscene, along with the opening credits depicted in a ""Photoshop speedpaint"" style, also left something to be desired. Additionally, Eddie Murphy's portrayal of a self-insert of Kenya Barris, who heavily focuses on the dislike of bi-racial people, detracted from the overall viewing experience.

"Zero spoilers in here. Absolutely wonderful. I can't do a big braining on what everything means in this crazy topsy-turvy roller-coaster of a movie, but it's one hell of an entertaining ride if you just sit back and enjoy it. For me, this movie needed to be watched the same way I watched Lost Highway - don't try to understand it, just be open to being frightened and entertained. Suffering from generalized anxiety myself, the first part of the movie is absolutely brilliant, showing the world through the lens of someone with a severe case of anxiety. Everything is over the top, and the attention to detail is stunning.The movie devolves further and further into madness, somewhat akin to the way it did in Mother, except not in a frustrating way, but rather an action-packed and crazy, sometimes touching way. Oh, and hilarious. There are such funny moments in this movie, often absurdly so.I didn't read up on anything before watching this movie, and I had no idea it was going to be three hours. I didn't know Ari Aster made it, and frankly I didn't know who he was. Looking it up afterwards, I see he made Midsommar, which I found tedious and boring, and Hereditary, which I absolutely loved.I can definitely see how someone could hate this movie. I can also sympathize with being frustrated with it if trying to understand everything. I think the best way to watch this is popcorn. Watch this like you'd watch a popcorn flick, except expect absurdities instead of explosions (though we do get explosions here, too). That's how you'll be entertained by this amazing movie. I'll be watching this again.Oh, and Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar for this performance. Absolutely his most impressive performance so far.Watch this. It's special.

"**_This review may contain spoilers._**Nimona might be the most joyful film I've watched in a very long time. Anime or not, it's just.pure.unadulterated.fun!Putting aside for a moment the serious subtext of the story, Nimona is a first-class super-hero, and with very real, very human emotions. On top of all that, she is a first-rate comedian too. ""Arm chopping is not a love language."" (Nimona read Chapman's book!) If I heard she was going to be at the Improv, I'd be looking for tickets!Chloë Grace Moretz hit this character right over the outfield wall. The script, the animation, and Chloë combine to make Nimona completely magnetic. Empathize with a character? I was totally in love.Riz Ahmed, the other lead voice, leveled right up to Chloë's energy. He played the double-minority cross he bore, with reality and complexity. Those two under-dogs make the best ever super-heroes.The story about the production is that Disney dropped Blue Sky for ""balance sheet reasons"", with the film already 70% finished. I have serious doubts that Disney would ever let this film go untouched. Kudos to Annapurna and Netflix for picking this up.Which brings us to the serious subtext. The script here is amazing. ""It's complicated.""The early, and obvious, tip-off that the script is ""inclusive"", and actually about the LGBTQ+ crowd, is the gay relationship of Ballister Braveheart and Ambrosius Goldenloin. What hilarious names for these two characters. Ambrosius from the Greek meaning food of the gods. Ballister, also from Greek, meaning a type of weapon that throws something, a catapult or a crossbow.It's truly not unreasonable to have a gay character in this story. Statistically speaking, even if you used a low 3% percentage of the population is gay (although it's more like 5-8%), then the odds of having at least one gay in a graduating class of 30 men is much better than an even money bet (60% probability to be exact). As a matter of fact even money says it's more likely to have 8-9 gays in a class of 30. I'm not kidding, or even, as Mark Twain, put it, a damn liar.Two gay knights in the same class actually kissing then, is realistic and honest, given the statistics. No reason to raise a banner announcing it (Disney would have). It's only marginally relevant to the plot.Now, I wouldn't presume to tell ND Stevenson, the author of the manga, what he meant. Yet, I see this girl, ""What are you?"" ""I am Nimona."", who can only say she is herself. She didn't say girl. She is a shapeshifter. A shapeshifter? a girl who is different? Who sees herself as different? A girl who maybe doesn't identify quite exactly as other girls? I see Nimona as the T in LBGTQ+. She is the symbolic ""transgender"" of the film that has a macho Todd, a gay Ambrosia, and an evil, intolerant Director who believes her view is the only valid one. If the MAGA hat fits, I say she wears it.At some point, even Ballister who is also ""different"", but maybe not so much as Nimona, struggles to not call her a ""monster"". That is really the next level of meaning in the film: The people that want to ""drive a sword into the heart of anything different."" This peer pressure from the xenophobic crowd tempts even Ballister who, in his (brave)heart, knows it's wrong.Ultimately, it's Nimona who exposes the subtext by telling us about her very real depression induced by society not accepting her as she is. Throughout life, she was constantly isolated, threatened and rejected for being Nimona - for being the shape-shifting (gender-shifting) she identifies as. Ballister asks her ""What if you held it in? If you didn't shape-shift?"" ""I'd die."" is her serious answer. If a person identifies as something different than her appearance, how can they deny that and live?Depression is the real ""monster"" of the story. In this case, depression literally becomes the demon shape of Nimona. The demon can attack outward, and also inward. This is a truth of depression. A brilliant therapist once told me that depression is anger turned inward.Anger turned inward, becoming depression, can have serious consequences. Do I need mention Robin Williams, Marilyn Monroe, Kurt Cobain, Sylvia Plath, Hunter Thompson, Vincent Van Gogh, and probably someone you know personally? Even Nimona recognizes this. ""I don't know what's scarier. The fact that everyone in this kingdom wants to run a sword through my heart... or that sometimes, I just wanna let 'em.""Many artists, in every field, also feel this depression of not being accepted. Of being different somehow. Of being ridiculed and not understood. Of being alone in a world that doesn't see them as they really are. Nimona is able to turn that anger outward as a mischievous punk. For a while, anyway. Depression is a serious disease.I was brilliantly blind-sided to see this subject treated by this film. I suspect everyone in the LGBTQ spectrum suffers this to some degree. I'm so amazed and thankful that ND Stevenson, Annapurna and Netflix brought this subject forward at the same time that Republicans are banning gender-affirming care in red states.Regardless of the underlying cause, depression can be helped by therapy, tolerance, acceptance, and, as Ballister showed us, love.",961323,badelf,10.0,Positive

"As someone who was a victim of child sexual abuse myself and as someone who admittedly likes Trump (who praised this movie to no end) and also as a tiny bit of conspiracy nut and seeing all the mainstream media attack this movie and trying to smear it, I really, REALLY wanted to like and support and even praise this movie - but I just can't.I have to admit that it's a bit difficult for me to agree with the mainstream media's warning about this movie, but they really are correct for once - sometimes they throw you curve balls like that. I mean after all, there was a time when I trusted the mainstream media and I lost trust in them not because they were mainstream, but because they just started to get a lot of things wrong. But that also means that if they get things right for once, I can't just categorically disagree with them.And it's really not like they are just smearing this movie for no good reason. They do (for the most part) have a valid point. This movie does nothing to actually stop this crime or to help the victims or to help people recognize this crime when they see it. On the contrary, because it claims to be based on true events, it causes people to have a completely wrong impression about this and therefore makes it harder for people to detect it when it's happening, because this movie is less accurate in its depiction of the real world than a Liam Neeson action thriller. Actually, Liam Neeson's recent film ""Memory"" was pretty good and actually much more accurate in it's depiction of child trafficking than this movie.Because this movie really does nothing but reinforce outdated and completely wrong stereotypes. This type of thing isn't something that mainly happens in South America or in ""other"" countries and children don't just get kidnapped out of the blue by complete strangers and against their will. The sad truth is that most cases don't involve a stranger at all, but someone the child trusts and the child isn't gonna come running to you begging for help, cause the truth is they are victims of years of extremely systematic and sophisticated psychological manipulation.And the perpetrators aren't all tough guys either. Actually a lot of them are quite educated, sophisticated and female because they don't raise suspicion. And also it's not just about forcing the kids to make movies - that only plays a very, very small part, but this movie would have you believe that that's the main part - that's the smallest part by far! Most of the aspects involved are MUCH worse than ""just"" that. And as much as I would love to think that there are plenty of officers (official or rogue) of government security agencies who are incorruptible and ceaselessly fight the ""bad guys"" in relentless sting operations, the reality sadly isn't as clear cut. Yes, sometimes SOME children do get rescued, but actually very rarely by police, much less government security agencies.

"Propaganda Piece Use any weakness your opponent may have. This is the killer way (from Sun Tzu's - The Art of War). Netflix on the other hand knows that our weakness is K Drama. So in order to get its woke message of civilization deconstruction it cunningly wraps it up as an action movie. A cynical, glossy, over-dramatic mess of an action movie that is also quite full of itself. Western movie festivals proudly endorse it. After all it has been stamped by the rainbow people and they decide what art is nowadays. A weak K drama copy art-house wannabe stunk up by Woke town politics and weak action scenes which I will soon forget. But not forgive. A pity with all the talented cast. I will not watch Netflix productions again. Hope they go under like Bud light, but I'm afraid it's too late for the US and Western Europe (some westernized Asian countries included). If you don't believe me or think I'm being unfair, watch Yuri Bezmenov's lecture on societal ideological subversion techniques and stages (demoralization-destabilization-crisis-normalization) on YouTube. To bring about societal crisis and further divide the population, you need to create oppressed groups, radicalize them and give them power. Introduce ideas of ""equality"" and ""inclusion"", demonize the police and erase religion to create new cults and ideologies. Turn all values upside down. Sounds familiar ?

So, sit back, get comfortable and be entertained. As for ""woke"" whatever and ""the message it brings"", people who suffer due to that (whatever it is), seem to see it everywhere!

I was expecting another low budget outing with a few known names on the marquee and was pleasantly surprised. The story is a bit slow, but well worth the watch.

"The only way for this movie to wow you is to give it some respect. Ultimately, this movie is not for everyone and that's okay.Simply, Skinamarink is a mood piece. Most people come into the horror genre to mock the stupid decisions of the characters, gawk at the intense gore, or to be thrilled in a safe environment. This movie, however, will leave those viewers with nothing. This movie is for the viewers who want to be enveloped by the liminal mood. It sends them back to their childhood, when they were afraid to walk around their house at night. It sent me back to when I would sneak downstairs to try to watch some cartoons and eat cereal, leaving the house dark and quiet so I don't wake anyone else up.Most of this film is a blank screen with VHS-like fuzz that tricks your mind into seeing things that aren't there. The cinematography is brilliant in the way that it always shows you JUST enough that you want to peek around the corner, but you also don't want to. The amount of interpretations of this very simple movie speaks to its density. The symbolism and ambiguity let the mind run wild with theories and explanations.If I were to change one thing, then I would make the movie at least a half hour shorter. It would be way more approachable if it were more like ""The Backrooms"" by Kane Pixels on YouTube. However, I also feel like the length is necessary to fully set the viewer in the mindset to fully enjoy the second half of the film. Thankfully, there is no producer to get in the way of Kyle Edward Ball's genius film making.I suggest watching this movie at night with no external noise and no distractions, sitting on the floor of your living room to get the full experience. Give it the respect it deserves. And if you can't get into the mood they expect, then you might as well turn off the TV and watch the empty screen for two hours.",994143,Big_Wooper,10.0,Positive
"Bawdy, raunchy humor generally isn’t my style, but, when it’s done with wit, creativity and no-holds-barred originality, it gets my attention quickly, which this filmmaking debut from writer- director Adele Lim captures from the very first line of the picture (and never lets go thereafter). This rapid-fire screwball comedy follows the exploits of four young Asian women (Ashley Park, Sherry Cola, Sabrina Wu, Stephanie Hsu) on an outlandish road trip through China that steadily deteriorates but routinely places them in a host of raucously hilarious, debauchery-riddled situations. In doing so, the film steadily serves up huge laughs in a story that’s accurately being billed as a release unlike anything that moviegoers have seen before. While it’s true that the narrative stretches credibility a bit at times and the film has its share of predictable and sweet but sappy moments, those minor faults are vastly overshadowed by its many strengths, including its fine ensemble cast, balanced pacing, and vibrant, colorful, superbly crafted production design. Because of the nature of the humor, however, sensitive viewers may want to skip this one (though it’s truly hard not to laugh, no matter how conservative one’s views might be). “Joy Ride” may not have received much fanfare or pre-release publicity, but it’s one of the funniest comedies to come along in quite some time, and it’s handily one of the best offerings of what has thus far been an otherwise-stunningly disappointing summer movie season. Indeed, get ready to seriously laugh your ass off with this one.",864168,Brent_Marchant,8.0,Positive
"Movie is really good, but there is one obvious flaw and one important condition:Flaw: you'll have to endure every scene about Jann's relationships. With the parents it's just very predictable — just try to imagine, they didn't believe in him and persuaded to drop his dreams and find proper job. Of course, you know what will happen in the end. Okay, relationships with parents are always important, but WHY DID THEY ADD SCENES WITH THE GIRLFRIEND? Thanks for showing Tokyo during their weekend there, but I still can't understand the reason to add her in the first place — they didn't have conflicts, interesting dialogues or even support, really. I'm sure creators could invest time to more interesting and important topics.But anyway, this flaw disappears in the shadow of other, actually important stuff. Racing.So yeah, let's return to the condition: you have to love it when cars go BRRRRR. The main reason behind this movie is to sell you GT7 for your PS5, and believe me, after leaving the cinema, you'll at least check if there are any discounts for the game right now (yes, there are). Sound, shooting angles, tension during races — everything works perfectly and beyond! Just when you become bored, you'll be in for a surprise. When you want a new angle, you'll get it. When you forget who the sponsor of the movie is, you'll see graphics from the video game.So, just believe me, if you love races, you have to go to the movie right now. Just select cinema with quality sound, please :)And as a bonus, you'll get David Harbour, who's stealing absolutely every scene. Love him!",980489,scherbakovx,8.0,Positive

"You know, while the mixed reviews had me a little worried this wouldn't live up to my hype, my faith never wavered. It seems my conviction was justified, because my goodness is this a masterpiece! So good in fact, that I missed the last direct bus back home because I was so engrossed in discussing it afterwards - if my misfortune is not an endorsement, then I don't know what is!If you've seen Hero and House of Flying Daggers, then you can know what to expect from the plot here: a semi-historical account of a band of usurpers, plotting with wild abandon against tyrannical authority, inside a twisty plot as loyalties shift in constant flux, amounting to a grand political stance as reality reveals itself to be far too complicated for any one person to fully grasp. Yet Zhang no longer seems to care as much for spectacle as he used to, because while there's for sure still action here - and my god is it brutal, displaying the sheer ruthlessness of Chinese history in all its glory - it's no longer nearly as stylish as what he once revelled in. Which works to the film's favour, as it means it can purely focus on the central enigma it strives to unravel, with the character's far more likeable and their motivations far easier to digest because they're no longer so frustratingly aloof - Jackson Yee is the last remnant of this, but it works to brilliant effect as his 'straightmanness' violently clashes with all the other absurdities he gets swept up in.Instrumental to this is the comedy, which laces the mind-blowing screenplay with wit at every turn, each revelation and each despair underscored by a relentless pursuit of humour that envelopes the intrigue inside a bundle of perpetual laughs. And when you have an audience as engrossed in the humour as yourself, it all becomes that much more endearing. Zhang isn't unfamiliar to comedy, as he's been experimenting with it since Red Sorghum; it just took comedic geniuses like Shen Teng and Zhang Yi to fully realise their potential by imbuing the charming jokes with their own remarkably enchanting screen presence. Also, best Shen Teng performance? Because while he's as hilarious as I knew he would be, he's also so effective at delivering the really quite moving drama, burdening himself with layers upon layers to become utterly mesmerising to witness. This may very well be Zhang's most entertaining piece; the fact that it's paired with his most slickly written and inventive - yet likewise emotionally charged and passionate - screenplay in recent years makes the experience all the better.",1066298,AshJohann,10.0,Positive
"Some good jokes, but also a lot of group think and not a very authentic comedian imo.I liked the start, then he get into his usual black vs white group thinking, which i find tedious and to me it seems as if he hasn't trancended race at all, he's still very identified with that ... He is often repeating his sentences and thereby seems like a drama queen trying to hype things up.Some jokes in the special were really quite good, but in general i think he's lightyears behind other comedians, who are also much more authentic than him. He seems to want to be as courageous and deep as Chappelle, but he is just not ...

"In the 1980s, actor Michael J. Fox burst onto the entertainment scene as one of the decade’s mega-stars with the success of his hit TV show Family Ties and a string of popular movies, most notably the iconic sci-fi comedy, “Back to the Future” (1985). Before long, he was seemingly everywhere all at once, a fitting development for someone who had lived his life like that from the time he was a child. This frenetic pace of living had followed him for so long, in fact, that he never learned how to be, as this film’s title suggests, still. In 1990, however, he received a medical diagnosis that nearly stopped him in his tracks – he was discovered to be suffering from Parkinson’s Disease, an illness that usually strikes in old age, not someone on his late 20s. It forced him to take stock of himself and his life, though he tried desperately (and surprisingly successfully) to conceal it for years thereafter. His unwillingness to confront the truth about his condition continued a practice that he had been carrying out in other areas of his life for years, his hectic, distracted way of living keeping him in denial and, sadly, giving him a reason to drown himself in alcohol. But he couldn’t continue living that way forever as the disease began to take its course, his illness serving as a much-needed wake-up call to get real. Based on the title character’s writings, director Davis Guggenheim’s latest documentary feature tells the protagonist’s story using an inventive combination of archive footage, interviews with Fox, actor-based re-creations of incidents from his life and footage from his treatment sessions that candidly depict how far his condition has progressed. There are also a number of sequences in which his story is told through fittingly poignant clips from his movie and TV projects, ironically reminding us that art can indeed imitate life. All of these elements combine to present a compelling and touching story, although the film admittedly has some initial difficulty finding traction to tell it. Otherwise, though, “Still” offers an honest, insightful look into the life of a very public figure who has been fighting a very private battle and the effects that effort has had on shaping and evolving his professional, personal and philanthropic pursuits. Most of all, however, it shows us how we can identify what’s been missing from our lives and take steps to implement it, no matter how unusual the means may be for showing us the way.",1058699,Brent_Marchant,8.0,Positive
"An AMAZINGLY well done perspective of Parisians Disease as it impacts a person and changes their life forever.I related this film to a close personal friend diagnosed with the same disabling disease. Over the course of time he opted in for a special surgery that implants two devices in the body. This act, was worth the wait as his uncontrollable shaking attacks diminished enough he drives again, rode a 100 miles on his bicycle and ... well, lives as close to ""normal"" as people without the disease.I love Michael's approach allowing the crew to see exactly how this impacts his life. The inclusion of his growth on TV / Movies was a great addition.The amazing, most crazy part of all of this is his absolutely adoring family. His wife sticking through EVERY piece of his life as HE struggles with loosing all things he could do on his own.

"**Not sure if it's a good Christian movie, but it's a great horror movie**Great movie, even though in a way it sets itself up for failure, because a Christian audience doesn't usually appreciate a good psychological horror movie and horror fans usually don't like a movie made by Christians promoting Christian values.So there is no big demographic that really appreciates a movie like this and it's obvious that the makers of this movie knew that too and were doing it to simply make a good movie for those who can appreciate it (no matter how few there might be).So I am not sure if it even really wants to be a good Christian movie or a good psychological horror movie, but either way it does succeed at being both.For a movie about demonic possession it's also surprisingly realistic. And I say that as someone who has worked as a guard in prisons and mental institutions. There are a few extremely minor inaccuracies but these are necessary for the plot or are for safety reasons (after all, not everyone needs to know what exactly the actual safety measures in a prison actually look like in detail).There actually already is an almost identical German movie called ""Der Totmacher"" (The Deathmaker). Though I am sure no one involved in this movie saw it, even though it's essentially the same movie and that's because that German movie's entire script simply consists entirely of the actual transcripts of an actual psychological evaluation of an actual serial killer. But that's how close to reality this all actually is.",913673,EmmanuelGoldstein,10.0,Positive

"**_Biopic of Greg Laurie and the Jesus Movement of the late ’60s/early ’70s_**A pastor in Costa Mesa (Kelsey Grammer) is concerned about the counterculture’s obsession with drugs and loose sex, but also his dying church that isn’t connecting with the youth. His daughter (Ally Ioannides) brings home a hippie “Jesus freak” (Jonathan Roumie) and he sees that he’s genuine and gifted. The team-up sparks a movement that spreads for the next several years.""Jesus Revolution” (2023) is a well-done account of the Jesus Movement in SoCal between 1968-1971. It’s made in such a way that anyone who’s interested in that era and the social upheaval that was going on will appreciate it, similar to ""Forrest Gump"" except with more overt spirituality. For instance, there’s Janis Joplin, Timothy Leary and several iconic songs, e.g. “Free Ride,” “Listen to the Music” and “War.”While I’m somewhat familiar with Greg Laurie and his ministry, I wasn’t aware that he got his start in the Jesus Movement, nor was I familiar with Chuck Smith or Lonnie Frisbee, the latter of whom “backslid” and died of AIDS at the premature age of 43 in 1993.Grammer and Joel Courtney are effective as the main male protagonists, Chuck Smith and Greg Laurie respectively. Meanwhile the lovely Anna Grace Barlow is a winsome revelation as Cathe, Laurie’s potential girlfriend.While not as inspiring as ""War Room"" (2015), it’s arguably superior to ""Do You Believe?"" (2015), “God’s Not Dead” (2014), ""God's Not Dead 2"" (2016) and ""Overcomer"" (2019). It’s at least on par with any of ’em.The film runs 2 hours and, was shot in Fairhope, Alabama, which is just southeast of Mobile, with several other scenes shot on-location in the coastal Los Angeles area.GRADE: B+/A-",719256,Wuchak,8.0,Positive
"It wasn’t all that long ago when the LGBTQ+ community not only didn’t have legal protections for its rights, but also faced blatant discrimination against its constituents, prejudiced initiatives aimed at denying them equal treatment under the law and even subjecting them to lawfully sanctioned ostracism. This was true even in “civilized” and “progressive” societies like those found in North America and Europe. And it prompted individuals to live in fear of losing their jobs and leaving them open to ridicule without ramifications, not to mention disrespect and mistrust from their own families. Those chilling conditions are ominously brought to light in this period piece drama set in the UK in the late 1980s, when Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government sought the passage of Section 28, legislation aimed at prohibiting activities openly promoting homosexuality, a bill carrying wide-sweeping implications for the LGBTQ+ community. Many of its constituents, like a young lesbian physical education teacher (Rosy McEwen), retreated into the closet to keep out of sight. But those efforts derailed whatever social progress had been made, damaging those individuals’ self-esteem and creating a divisive schism between those who vociferously demanded justice and those who chose to keep a low profile to protect themselves, as evidenced by the experiences of the teacher and her out and proud girlfriend (Kerrie Hayes). Writer-director Georgia Oakley’s debut feature does a fine (if somewhat predictable) job of illustrating this rift and the effects it had on both the public and personal lives of these people, an effort that earned the film a 2022 BAFTA Award nomination for Best Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer. Admittedly, the picture’s opening act meanders a bit, but, once it gets on track, when the emergence of various damning revelations threatens to blow things wide open, it steadily grows more powerful and heartfelt, qualities supported by the fine performances of the cast, solid writing, and its skillfully crafted atmospheric cinematography and production design. It also provides viewers with a potent cautionary tale about the effects of initiatives like Section 28 (which was in force from 1988 to 2003) and the parallels to this legislation that are currently under consideration in various US jurisdictions. It effectively shows us how Jean became so blue – and how we should seek to prevent the same from happening to the rest of us.",971699,Brent_Marchant,7.0,Positive

"This tell-all surface Netflix documentary profiles one of the most famous women of the 1990's and 2000's, and covers the exact same material that I, a non-fan, have seen before. Think of it as ""The E! True Hollywood Story (Now with Bewbs!).""Vickie Lynn Marshall was from Mexia, Texas (which is filmed like it's one of Dante's Circles of Hell). Born in 1967, she was a beautiful child who attracted attention almost immediately. She married early, had a child, and ran away from an abusive homelife, ending up dancing in strip clubs in Houston. She met another stripper there who would become a lover, and Vickie changed her name to Nikki. Pictures of Smith (her married name) made their way to Playboy and Guess Jeans, and a model was born. Now known as Anna Nicole Smith, she descended on Los Angeles, taking modeling gigs and an occasional film role (she was offered only $50,000 to appear in ""The Mask""?!), and becoming more and more famous for not doing very much. Behind the scenes, she was seeing and married an oil billionaire sixty years older than her. Drugs became a part of Smith's life, starting out as pain medication for her breast augmentation surgery. Her son, Daniel, was by her side as she saw billionaire J. Howard Marshall, and the stripper friend, before her life began to spiral out of control- which was caught on camera by ever-present paparazzi, and eventually her own infamous ""reality"" show. She died after giving birth to a daughter in 2007, but her life made tabloid headlines even years after she was laid to rest.One of the many flaws in this documentary is an odd one- it's not long enough. We get six hours on serial killers and their ""unheard"" audio tapes, but less than two hours on a household name who was literally in the public eye for fifteen years? Smith had a rough upbringing, and an hour could have been spent on her parents alone, instead of a gotcha moment that seems tacked on to the end of the film. The film makers could not get some important interviews that could have opened up the documentary either, so Howard K. Stern and Larry Birkhead are relegated to ""archive footage"" roles. Smith seemed to be surrounded by enablers, some of whom do talk, but she's as much a mystery after the documentary as she is before. Talking about her deep love for Marshall while she was having a fling with her stripper friend is given a pass, as is footage of Smith presenting a giant, inappropriate semi-nude picture of herself to the old man while her toddler son is standing there. Was Smith a pathological liar, an innocent, a narcissist? I don't know, and neither do the film makers. Instead, we unironically get old footage of shamed newsman Brian Williams lecturing the mainstream media and public for treating Smith's death with so much attention before playing video from other news outlets. It's a fine balance between giving the public what they want, and shoving this exposure down our throats. We finally got rid of hanging on Paris Hilton's every move, yet she still tries to get back in the spotlight every couple of years. Is it any better today? No, one of the last articles I saw on Fox News' website was about Demi Lovato's difficulties sticking to preferred pronouns. How many hours did people waste watching Smith's show, or news stories about her daughter's questionable paternity? Or the case that went all the way to the Supreme Court about her husband's estate? What did you do with that knowledge? Just like me after watching this, you hopefully cracked open a book and moved on with your life.I never saw her ""reality"" show, or paid much attention to her when she was in the news. I don't hate her, I think it's sad that a person would go through all of this to become rich and famous, and to have that same fame completely destroy her life, and the lives of those around her. This isn't a cautionary tale, because very few celebrities today are taking this caution and leading fulfilling lives. I hope her daughter is being raised ""normally,"" and everyone caught in the hurricane existence of Anna Nicole Smith has moved on as well- including the producers of this documentary.",1114590,CharlesTatum,2.0,Negative
"Just a delight!!!!!!A well produced movie with one of the most logical and sensible storylines for movies in this genre.I went into this with the expectation of a subpar experience, get a few laughs and wrap up.This blew all expectations away, it starts out slow giving us details and development into the main characters lives before they meet and intertwine, the depth of story, the exploration of what family can mean sometimes, the sacrifices (if you'd call them that) that one makes for family and why someone else cannot see themselves fitting into such a system.It's crazy because in our own lives, these issues are there, these issues persist, a lot of people would have smiled and still gone into it, and later down the line explode and say it wasn't what they signed up for.This goes a step beyond that showing us what can happen if someone decides, ""I'm not a right fit, I have to go"" The aftermath of that decision, the subsequent exchange of truth and the final decision, even up to showing a future timeline of the final decision. This movie gave me chills, made my heart ache, made me laugh, made me sad, and made me really happy with the ending.The production was spot on, cinematography was great, actors were awesome, the sound was sublime, the story blended well and it was great!It lacks the usual family ""hate"" drama we've come to expect from these types of movies and that's not a bad thing by any measure. Though I'll admit the kneeling scene was a bit too dramatic for me, way too dramatic and pointless but I see the necessity of what they did, they had at least five ways they could've spun it but still, in the end it was good.If there was a scale of 10 to recommend this, it'll be a hearty 11.Enjoy this,Cheers.",611359,Slicky_07,10.0,Positive
"I really wanted to give this film a try. But after watching it for 22 minutes, I couldn't endure anymore. At the beginning, there is a narrative part which I find very interesting. Because of that, I continued to watch it to the length of 22 minutes. That being said, when it reached to 22 minutes, I could bear it anymore. The acting is terrible. I can understand the children's acting. They are still young, so, it wouldn't be great as I have expected. But I find the parents action is also not that good.

"""Viduthalai"" is an exceptional cinematic masterpiece that showcases the impeccable craftsmanship of Vetrimaaran.

"Plagued by a poor story line and even worse acting. I get the impression they chose Daniel Stisen as lead actor purely because of his physique.

"A standard action Korean flick, if it weren't for the scarce elevated violence it wouldn't have been as watchable. The writer seems to be slipping a bit too much for what would have been obvious. The main character is a boxer and that's how we were introduced to him but being a boxer didn't play any role into the narrative. There were many other examples of that. More often than not, whenever a character is trying to act ""cool"" it came across as cheesy since there is a clear lack in world building and character development.",1057001,ParkMin,4.0,Negative
"**Jithu Madhavan's debut film is a hysterical laugh riot which cackles you up.**Romancham is a hilarious , side splitting horror comedy which breaks genre boundaries in the most organic way by virtue of its fantastic and spontaneous situational humour. The film takes a good 20-25 mins for the hysteria to unleash, and when the humour kicks in it delivers entertainment in abundance. Jithu Madhavan's debut as a director is fabulous and commendable. The horror elements arent typical jump scares but the errie atmospheric tension along with the stunning facial expressions serve the purpose.The film works because of the excellent score by Sushin Shyam which drives the entire film, smashing ensemble performances from the entire cast and smartly written story which toys with you and keeps you guessing. Soubin Shahir and Arjun Ashokan's distinctive performance light up the entire film as their presence itself makes the entire scene hilarious.Overall if you appreciate great, innovative and rooted cultural flicks which reinvents horror-comedy for good , then donot miss this. It brings in the unfiltered madness which cheers you up and haunts you a little. Its said that the story is based on real events of 7 bachelors in 2007 makes it even more scary.Instagram @streamgenx.",976121,mynameritesh,8.0,Positive

I'm looking for anything other than these podcasts with regard to publicity... seems like it was dumped out there with no regard for the results.

"The 3rd Guest"" had all the potential to be a gripping and suspenseful thriller, but unfortunately, it fell short of expectations. From the promising premise to the initial buildup, it seemed like an intriguing journey awaited the audience. However, as the story unfolded, it became evident that the film failed to deliver on its potential, leaving viewers feeling unsatisfied and somewhat disheartened.One of the main issues with ""The 3rd Guest"" was its pacing. The slow and meandering narrative failed to maintain the tension and excitement necessary for a successful thriller. Rather than keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, the film tended to drag, leaving ample room for disinterest to creep in.Another notable letdown was the underdeveloped characters. Despite a talented cast, their performances were hindered by the lack of depth in their respective roles. Viewers were left craving a stronger emotional connection and backstory, which could have added much-needed substance to the film's overall impact.Moreover, the plot twists, which are a crucial element in any thriller, felt forced and predictable in ""The 3rd Guest."" Instead of surprising and shocking the audience, they came across as contrived and clichéd, undermining the intended suspense. The script failed to explore the full potential of the storyline, leaving viewers with a lingering feeling of missed opportunities.Visually, the film had some redeeming qualities. The cinematography was skillfully executed, capturing the gloomy atmosphere and enhancing the eerie undertones of the narrative. However, the technical prowess alone could not salvage the overall disappointment of the film.""The 3rd Guest"" had the ingredients for a chilling and memorable thriller, but unfortunately, it failed to deliver on its promises. Lacking in pacing, character development, and genuine suspense, the film left viewers feeling empty and unfulfilled. It's a regretful example of a missed opportunity to create a compelling and engaging cinematic experience.Given its budget constraints & potential to improve with a follow up, I am giving it high marks of 9/10 on the low budget indie spectrum.",1069175,johncakes,10.0,Positive
"In ""The 3rd Guest,"" Nikki Kris plays the role of Evie, who finds herself caught in a web of supernatural events. Her on-screen presence injects a refreshing dose of humor into the horror genre, striking a perfect balance between levity and tension.The film's script is peppered with smart and snappy dialogue, allowing Kris to showcase her comedic timing and charm. Beyond the witty banter and comedic relief, ""The 3rd Guest"" also succeeds in building a genuinely creepy atmosphere. The cinematography plays with shadows and lighting, heightening the sense of unease as the story progresses. The tension is expertly maintained, and the occasional jump scare will keep you on your toes.While the film does lean into the horror tropes we all know and love, it manages to subvert expectations with unexpected plot twists and a satisfying conclusion. It's a testament to both Kris's talent and the storytelling prowess of the filmmakers, as they successfully navigate the fine line between homage and originality.""The 3rd Guest"" is an enjoyable horror film that breathes new life into the genre, thanks in large part to Nikki Kris's magnetic performance. It's a delightful blend of scares and laughter, providing an entertaining and engaging experience for horror enthusiasts and casual moviegoers alike.

"INT. COOKIE MONSTER – NIGHTMonster is the latest entry in the Kore-eda filmography (a filmography I still need to dive deeper into). Still, just like his previous films, It's a deeply personal look into a character, their motives but most importantly, how that motive affects those around them.Monster is a multi-layered beast; it retells one story from multiple perspectives giving us the whole cookie instead of just the crumbs. Usually, I'm a crumb kinda guy; I like to figure things out myself, putting them all together to get my cookie. Still, Kore-eda gives me the cookie; at points, he just hands the cookie over when instead I would have preferred the traditional 'show, don't tell' filmmaker mentality. Yet, without that one little critique Monster would have shot right up to a 4-star thanks to its standout performances from Sakura Ando as the mother and excellent direction (especially when it comes to blocking actors within a scene, yeah, I know a weird thing to point out but something I wrote down while watching) Anyway, please head out and see this one.

"”The only love that I really believe in, is a mother’s love for her children.”- Karl LagerfeldIt’s about time I started catching up with all the Asian horror in 2023 and that led me to pick out Singapore’s _Circle Line_; a 1 hour 19 minutes, survival horror-thriller creature feature.I have been stuck on the London Underground once for maybe 3 minutes and let me tell you was that 3 minutes the longest of my life, staring into the darkness around the train, wondering what was out there, what might happen if we didn’t start moving soon, and then, blissfully, the train whirred on the tracks and that was my nightmare over.This film is pretty much what my brain created over those 3 minutes and wee woo this is my nightmare.Can we talk about Jesseca Liu’s acting here? Her character is astounding, and so, so brave and I am in awe watching how she so naturally plays the role of a mother. I don’t know how much the harrowing backstory was needed, but, it definitely served a good role of character development and understanding. The main four characters were remarkable, and I was really rooting for all of them, from the pit of my stomach. The dad as well did amazing in his role and I am just immensely amazed at what the actors managed to do with their script.There’s something about this that’s just so centric to family and familial beliefs that is just strangely stunning. Maybe it’s the fact I haven’t watched all that many Singaporian films and I’m just new to the themes and formats they use, but it really took my breath away.This being said, it isn’t the best movie; it’s a creature feature set in 2023 in underground train tunnels. It’s either going to be up your alley or not, as the par with most creature features. But for me? I loved this. I love the feeling of dread and horror, the emotional constipation between familial units, and more. I can see why people did not like the ending, but, I love the ending.If you watch this with more of a focus on “family within tragedy and disaster”, the film hits a little more, I think. Monster looked hella good (and looking at those rats, we know where the CGI budget went). Acting was pretty good, if not great, and I’m very interested in what J. D. Chua comes out with in the future. Very tense and very good, albeit, weak in some areas and needed a bit of a tidy up. But, that promises more for the director and script writer(s) in the future, in my opinion, and it’s got me excited for future movies.",1055733,heartaem,8.0,Positive

It describes what she calls her idyllic childhood, though we learn that it was without its serious problems including a sibling suicide.The documentary gos on to describe her developing fame and career, both in theater and film. They tell the story mostly through friends and relatives and from readings from letters. We don’t have the usual parade of current movie stars or film critics, though there may be one or two. I was surprised to learn that there were lapses in her career, when the movie audience and/or film execs didn’t like her, or along break she took to care for an ailing Spencer Tracy. But as she described it, she always pushed herself to move forward, doing only what she wanted to do. She was a great negotiator, and many times she either formed a deal with a project she owned, or else made sure she got a favorable role.

"Adhil Maimoonath Asharaf directed the film, which starred Bhavana and Sharaf U Dheen in the key roles.

His young sister is the most wonderful thing in his life. They explore together, go on drives, and build memories. Jimmy meets his long-lost love Nithya alias Bhavana one day, and the remainder of the film is about how their lives unfold.Analysis of the film.1) There isn't much to expect, so if you go in that mindset, the film will not disappoint you.2) The narrative is about a lost love, reuniting with that love, and attempting to receive a second chance. We couldn't say it was a unique narrative, but it did calm our minds.3) The portrayal of love in this film is not in the form of desire or advertising of the extramarital affair, but rather of damaged relationships and lost relationships, which are presented convincingly.4) The lead pair, Bhavana and Sharaf U Dheen, had performed admirably. The little girl who played Sharaf's younger sister was beautiful. 5) Bijipal's BGM was peaceful.Overall, a watchable film.",950070,salmanulfarisi,7.0,Positive
" INT. THE ANATOMY OF ANATOMY OF A FALL - DAY Anatomy of a Fall is an excellent film crafted from the mind of Justine Triet. It's beautifully acted, shot, scored and edited together. So let's look at the Anatomy of Anatomy of a Fall . Story:The story revolves around the unconfirmed cause of death of Samuel , who has fallen out of his attic window. The only person in the house was his wife Sandra , Sandra Hüller , the prime suspect. Their son Daniel , blind from an unfortunate event, is the only witness. The story is from the perspective of Sandra , and just like any courtroom drama, details are revealed over time. Fortunately, it's at a steady pace, never announcing too much or too little, giving us the correct information at the right time. While I'm mostly positive about the story, some moments slow right down, and we come to a standstill; overall, thanks to the following few components, they considerably make up for the story's flaws. Performance: Its lead is Anatomy of a Fall's greatest asset, Sandra Hüller . She is tremendous, pulling no punches in the role of Sandra, the deceased's wife. For the rest of the cast, no one except the dog is ever greater than Sandra! Cinematography: The camera in this film is on a swivel, always moving, keeping us engaged. The camera uses Visual humour quite a bit, which is always great to see. Finally, the colour grade felt natural and, at times, warm, giving a homely vibe. Score:A simple piano piece plays throughout the film; it is excellent. Finally, the editing:This was a stand-out for me. It was cleverly cutting at points to hide us from the horrors but holding onto moments before it became too much. There's a lot of love about this film — a highlight of the Cannes 2023 run. FADE OUT.

"**Short, sharp and striking.  **_Metaphysical Comfort_ is a hauntingly (both literally and metaphorically) beautiful avant-garde short film that exposes the human psyche. It shows us what it means to be human and skilfully expresses the fundamental connection between us that transcends life and death. This film manages to achieve in 3 minutes what many feature films fail to do in 3 hours: it makes you feel. Whether you believe in ghosts or not, this story will warm your heart. It subtly uncovers precepts inherent to mankind; you will eventually find solace in grief; we are all a community. But most of all, _Metaphysical Comfort_ shows you that you are never alone. In times of sorrow, in times of joy, we are always here for each other. And this is an attribute that can never be stolen, not even by the cruel thief that is Death. **I’m touched metaphysically by this film and I don’t even have a ghost comforting me.**This short is truly the most impressive directorial debut I can remember in years and without a doubt speaks volumes on Arikatota’s work to come.",1159357,yiyzie,10.0,Positive
"A really powerful, emotional investigation into issues plaguing the pediatric mental health system: specifically, the lack of a robust pediatric mental health system in this county. Saw it with a panel discussion from the filmmaker and local mental health providers—it’s also been screened for multiple health care organizations and government officials, and it needs to be seen by more.The filmmakers sat down with the parents of pediatric psych ED patients, as well as adult former patients, hospital staff and administrators, and a bipartisan pair of lawmakers. The key message: an underdeveloped system forces children who need intense psychiatric support to languish in ERs around the country, waiting for placement in what may only be a few long term treatment beds in an entire state. It’s a terrible system, and everyone involved realizes it, but are hampered by severely access to long term psychiatric care of any sort, let alone for children.It’s rare for a doc about the failures of the medical system to feature so many figures from within prominent hospital systems stating so openly that they know how clearly they’re failing their patients—it clearly frustrates and bothers these provides, staff and administrators that they’re unable to provide the care they know will help, but can’t send patients anywhere else to get it. It’s effective evidence of how bad the problem has become.The film presents compelling patient and parent experiences on how ER boarding of children with psychiatric illness not only doesn’t help, but worsens problems, and how it stands in stark contrast to the ways the health care system is resourced to address medical needs (as a adult neurologist, I can say with confidence that the system is not always great at that either, but the point the film makes is strong nonetheless). While clear answers are not easy to come by, the filmmakers bring out some voices that are working to improve the system, while making a strong case for the necessity of greater public attention and advocacy.There is considerably more to investigate here, including the roots of the problem, the factors that have increased it over time, and the reasons as to which states fail to provide services that existing law requires, not to mention more in-depth analysis of possible solutions.",1149691,jksmith38@gmail.com,10.0,Positive

"'Doglike' is the perfect representation of the undergrounds of London. A simple, yet impactful dialogue between two people that, at first sign might look different, but that have more in common than they want to admit to each other. The director and writer captured, beautifully, the struggles of our society: reaching out to conclusions without knowing the real story behind a person and immediately making the worst assumptions out of an individual. It is a fascinating portrayal of how opportunities and situations can make someone, or leave them stranded to fend for themselves. Absolutely stunning!",1100006,lilla0815,10.0,Positive

"Written and Directed by Nitin Supekar, ‘Sarla Ek Koti’ is a meek attempt at displaying the vicious male gaze and its ramifications. The film is technically sleek but falters in the overall performances and a dragged screenplay.The film starts off with Bhikaji played by Omkar Bhojne, soundly sleeping in his courtyard as the whole village gathers around the house for a big announcement. The rusty landlord played by Yashpal Sarnat has come to claim the beautiful wife of Bhikaji, Sarla played by Isha Keskar, whom he won the day before while gambling with Bhikaji. Now arises the question whether thekedar’s decision to take her away is morally right or not.The thekedar then puts forward a deal asking Bhika to raise a hefty amount of 1 lakh rupees in 10 days in return for Sarla. Then starts Bhikaji’s journey of raising the amount and saving his wife.The first half of the film is filled with songs which break the chain of a smooth sailing story. The slow pace and too many arcs don’t really glue you to the screen. The second half picks up the pace but even then the meandering plot fails to stick to the point.The characters are written with such a weak emotional base that there is zero connection with their backstories. If actors with better comic timings were cast, the jokes would have landed brilliantly. The background music is on point. Omkar Bhojne and Isha Keskar’s chemistry is the only positive saving grace.Overall Sarla Ek Koti is an over the top attempt to display the vicious male gaze. A better screenplay and a slightly gripping story could have turned the tables for the film. Not recommended for watching with family and kids. Just wait for the OTT release.",1076682,smahind65@gmail.com,4.0,Negative

"**Clear winner!**The sheer naturalness of this film disproves the notion that success is a selfish goal, which is what the filmmakers have achieved. More tales like this one, with their less showy presentation of what they have to say, should be told. The movie can keep you interested despite its length, with the exception of the predictable finish. The pattern is largely conveyed through the story of dreams and adversity, but what jumps out most is the honesty with which emotions are handled. It keeps its heart in the right place throughout.It's clear that ""Orchestra Mysore"" is a beautiful film for this festival.",1072488,ramnathshanbhag,8.0,Positive

"An exciting return to Pandora: the world of Na&#39;vi. One of the best movies, like 2009&#39;s Avatar, to see in 3D! The characters seem to come out of the screen and it seems to witness the events firsthand. The world of Na&#39;vi has changed and is once again in danger. Man is the cause of evil as in reality. We are destroying our planet that used to be our Pandora. Pandora is our home, we are Pandora. The houses of the Na&#39;vi look like the tents of the American Indians, for me this is no coincidence and recalls the genocide of the American Indians. In my opinion it is a good sequel that deals with very relevant themes such as love, family and mourning. The initial water monologue which then returns towards the end is very poetic and universal! Emotional film that in some parts makes you cry. I recommend viewing in 3D for those who have already seen the previous film and were fascinated by that amazing world and the protagonist&#39;s love and life story.",76600,tmdb45226627,8.0,Positive
"**My rating: 10/10**Why? I rate any movie based on a few things. Warning! Potential Spoilers.**1. Story**. Is the story compelling, does it stick in your mind after the movie, haunting you like a ghost, forcing you to think about it and even your own life? Does it have any positive messages aka moral of the story.The story of The Way of Water is indeed compelling. The Conflict is multifaceted. Family conflict, Human-Na'vi conflict, Tribal Conflict and most importantly, personal conflict, aka identity conflict. The identity conflict is mostly fuelled by outcast feeling. There are a lot of people including Jake who at some point feel like they don't belong. I believe most people feel this way at some point in life, you don’t need to be in the protected minority groups for you to feel like an outcast. And while we may not be accepted for who we are, defining who are begins with ourselves first. Our world is full of people who want to be identified in one way or another. But have they identified themselves first? Just remember, most people feel discriminated for one reason or another in life. Religion, gender, skin colour, country, body size or smartness in school, political affiliation. Nobody gets love all round all times. Know who you are and don’t fuss to much about it. Learn a losson from Spider (Miles Socorro).**2. Characters**. Are there likeable characters you can get attached to? Characters you remember later, characters that inspire. Characters that grow.Spidey is a new character, and he has a great story to tell. Jake has changed a lot too and for good reason. People undergo a lot of transformation in life. You can’t be what Don Williams calls a Rake and Ramblin’ Man your entire life. I read an article review complaining how Jake tucked his tail and ran. That review completely missed the point. Jakes decision may not have been the right one, but put in his situation, it is a decision that a lot of people would make. **3. Acting**. Is the acting good? Is it realistic enough to be believable to a point you forget the people are just acting? I was more than impressed by Neytiri’s “gone nuts” scene. I felt her pain, and in that instance, I was nuts too. I honestly forgot this was just a movie. Actors can make you cry, and that is just how it should be. You forget that it is just an act, no need to cry. I also read an article that complained about the dialogue of the teenagers. I don’t know what the reviewer expected. Philosophy from teens? Their conversation is believable enough for their age.**4. Everything tied together**. A good story told by good and believable characters needs a setup. Something to tie them together into a bundle. Avatar ties everything together with wonderful visuals. I don’t need to say more.",76600,gaitanoayieko@gmail.com,10.0,Positive

"Like, how am I supposed to watch movies that take place on earth now?? Now that I’ve seen Avatar the way of water… it feels a bit… strange. I expected to be overwhelmed but the scale and scope of the film, I expected to have a good headache. But none of that happened. I have a very different feeling… I feel… Proud. Proud knowing that my faith in this film payed off. Proud that this film was indeed epic. Its not a perfect movie and I do have my flaws. But this film gave me about everything I could ask for when it comes to a movie going experience, this deserves to make serious money at the box. James Cameron said in his interviews that he is the ONLY person that could direct an avatar film, and the internets response was “James… Chill”, here’s the thing, he was right. I cannot imagine another director doing something like this. Everything you love from Cameron is here, Terminator 2, Titanic, etc. This was the best looking movie I’ve ever seen.. and no other film will match this in the future that isn’t an Avatar sequel. The VFX on the characters and creatures was perfect, no problems whatsoever. Sometimes some landscapes might have looked a little off, but the worst looking shot in this movie still looks better then almost every other CGI heavy action film. The underwater sequences was awe inspiring, I could’ve watched the underwater sequences in this film forever. the amount of work put into the underwater sequences definitely paid off. At first I wasn’t so sure about 48fps, during the first 20 or so minutes, I thought I would be detracted the whole time, but I wasn’t, I adjusted about half an hour in, and was completely emerged into a film like I never have before. The action in this movie was insane, the action was always at and 11 out of 10. You felt the scale, the weight, the stakes. Like I said, this wasn’t a perfect film. When the movie started, I was so sure about how I would feel about this movie. It starts voiceover heavy and with lots of quick cuts as if a lot has been cut from the film within the opening, Im sure there will be an extended cut to this, and I’m curious if it will add to it. The dialogue in the first film was the best, and this film does have stronger dialogue. But there are still a couple scenes where it did feel a little off, but it was mostly with the younger characters. As it wasn’t Constant, it was just like a line here to there every 20 minutes or so. While, I did say that the opening needed a little more to it, there are chucks in the middle that didn’t need to be there, and was just there to be eye candy, but it wasn’t really a big issue with me, Cause it was some of the best eye candy ever put on film.I’m tired of people complaining about the story to these avatar films, it feels like people put the plot to these movies on a unrealistic standard. The plot here is basic, and yeah, it might feel a little to basic at Times. But I don't really think it was something worth mentioning critically. Overall, this was a perfectly crafted film with a pretty good script, that provided a theater experience I’ll never forget.9.3/10",76600,JonathanWiddup,9.0,Positive
"Avatar 2 or Avatar: The Way of the Water came out on 4K Blu-ray a couple of weeks ago so me and the kids finally got around to watch it last weekend. I rarely go to the cinemas nowadays. It’s just too much hassle and way to expensive for four people. But there’s also no way I watch a big movie like Avatar on streaming with their over-compressed images and mediocre sound. Yeah, yeah, I know they claim Dolby Atmos and all that but they use almost one tenth the bit-rate for the video compared to 4K Blu-ray and push the Atmos over a lossy Dolby Digital stream.Anyway, enough rambling. Avatar: The Way of the Water was better than I feared it would be. I was really worried that it would turn out to be a preachy woke turd. Especially with some of the comments Cameron has made lately.Sure, it was pretty much a repeat of the first one with the companies bad, humans bad an all that kind of story but at least that was about it. There was not really any of the usual preaching, finger pointing and general woke force feeding that has been way too common from Hollywood lately.The main enjoyment of this movie is really the imagery, the scenery, the fantastic creatures and all that. It is a visually very beautiful movie.The second part of the enjoyment comes from some quite enjoyable action sequences, especially towards the end of the movie.The story is not much to write home about though. It is pretty standard, unimaginative story fairly full of the usual Hollywood lazy-ass unplausible shit. The idea that humanity in the future would go to another planet and start to hunt down the wildlife, behave like some conquistadors and literally strip the planet is fairly ludicrous from the start of course.The story is not so much about the main characters, or at least what I expected to be the main characters, but more about the kids. I was expecting it to be about the Na’vi kicking the invaders’ asses…again, but unfortunately the movie takes a different track rather early on.After that it is more of a coming of age story about their kids who, also unfortunately, behaves like the usual Hollywood teenagers in not listening to their parents and generally behaving recklessly. This part of the movie would have been really, really, boring if it was not for the beautiful scenery.Then there was this idea of an intelligent species, supposedly more intelligent than humans, being not only pacifists but refuses to defend themselves in any way while literally being exterminated. That kind of stupid shit only exists in the mind of a Hollywood writer. They also conveniently looked like whales so the script writer could push some bad-humans-catching-whales stereotypes.And why did they have to drag back the main the main asshole from the first movie? It just felt lazy and did not add to my enjoyment of the movie.Still, the bottom line is that I did enjoy the movie, even though it was over three hours long which felt a little bit dragged out. It is in no way this super blockbuster that some people seem to think though. At least not as far as I am concerned.",76600,Dark Jedi,7.0,Positive

"_**""Our scars can destroy us, even after the physical wounds have healed. But if we survive them, they can transform us. They can give us the power to endure, and the strength to fight.""**_Ever since it was announced that Matt Reeves was going to direct The Batman after Ben Affleck stepped down for personal reasons, I had no doubt he was going to put on one hell of a masterpiece. This is the definitive live-action Batman. An epic 3-hour film noir that delves deep into comic lore of Gotham City.Robert Pattinson perfectly embodies both Bruce Wayne and Batman. I love the character arc he goes through, realizing Gotham doesn't need vengeance to heal, but hope. Zoë Kravitz plays a phenomenal Selina Kyle, you actually feel her emotions throughout the movie. Another plus is that she actually feels integral to the plot (unlike The Dark Knight Rises). Paul Dano is a terrifyingly realistic interpretation of The Riddler, using the internet to gain a fan base for his sick games. Andy Serkis plays an excellent Alfred, being Bruce's emotional support during Dark times.The soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is absolute God-Tier. Elevating every scene with emotion and sometimes dread. Finally a score to rival Danny Elfman's iconic score. Matt Reeves direction is impeccable as always, getting some nice shots while also making it feel nice and claustrophobic around Batman.Overall, a God-Tier Batman movie that I can't wait for the Cinematic Universe that's being made around it as I type this.",414906,jwilliams0511971,10.0,Positive
"It's a cracker, no doubt about it!Matt Reeves did a great job with 2022's 'The Batman' . It's difficult not to compare this to other Batman films, though that's DC/Warner Bros. fault for featuring him so much in recent times. I'll get this out the way early: I'd say ' Batman Begins ' /' The Dark Knight ' are superior, not by much, which is a similar case for the character performances too.Robert Pattinson is a terrific Bruce Wayne, though Christian Bale still edges him out in my eyes. Zoë Kravitz is probably the best Catwoman I've seen, though the rest - from the Riddler to Penguin to Alfred - have been portrayed better; aside from Commissioner Gordon, with Jeffrey Wright being excellent. Paul Dano is the least enjoyable performer, for me, here, I found his showing to be a bit 'meh' - effective, but meh. Barry Keoghan makes a cameo, I won't say as who, but I don't hold high hopes for him in that role; though, apparently it won't be anything that happens anyway. For the best!Anyway... the above sounds way too negative - as I did thoroughly and absolutely enjoy this film, hence the very positive rating. The pacing is very good, the cinematography is brilliant (Gotham looks fantastically bleak!), the story is engrossing and the dialogue is on point. The scenes with Pattinson/Kravitz and Pattinson/Wright are my favourite moments. It's a film that I'd consider as 'outstanding'.It'll be cool to see what Reeves does with this trilogy (should it happen, of course).",414906,r96sk,9.0,Positive
"I like how Batman is depicted with a naive and loser POV from his rich high tower, a rich trust fund baby called out by both sane (Catwoman) and insane (Riddler) people while he remains oblivious until the consequences are literally flooding the city. While he uses the idea of Batman as a mantle for him to process trauma, his obliviousness to his own celebrity status and image creates unintentional side effects from his parents' death hogging the spotlight away from the people that mattered to his own nebulous idea of ""vengeance"" being co-opted by the goons, a heel-turn realization that eventually changes the rack focus, ultimately leading to a wider perspective and a selfless act of cutting the cord and helping others. Hope is more important than his idea of justice, in the end, empathy being the missing piece throughout. Instead of being a voyeur like Riddler during his master plan (Riddler binoculars on the mayor, Batman binoculars on Catwoman), he switches to being on the ground to help, no longer from his high castle.It's interesting how this arc plays out. At the beginning, it plays into this ""badass"" idea comic book fans love to gloat about Batman of striking fear into crime, but the way it's portrayed is frightening to everyone. It's a better criticism of Batman's fascism than BvS was going for, showcasing his fear to people who don't even deserve it, such as kids doing vandalism who probably believe the system is failing them, but to him at the beginning crime all looks the same.Honestly this film goes harder than Phantasm on the tragedy that is Bruce Wayne. They're inseparable by choice, to the point that Bruce basically is Batman even when not in the costume, a social recluse who can barely function in real life, listening to emo music and having rings around his eyes, a night owl to the extreme. The struggle is there even as Batman, literally smashing his face on a truck.There are some contradictions throughout thematically, however. It's weird how it goes between ""it's the WHOLE system, all cops are pigs"" to ""it's just bad apples"" simultaneously, displaying a somewhat cringe centrism. Catwoman by the end basically points it more to systemic (and Batman and Thomas Wayne's criticism of thinking they know better and actually makings things worse isn't undercut, which by itself is also institutional criticism), although it still feels like they could've done more. Maybe out of their hands by the studio or this as far as they could get away with vs. the producers (it almost felt like a struggle for Catwoman to outline her ""eat the rich"" mentality). Gotham itself is a mess of contradictions and it's OK to let the viewer lie between it all I guess.Also the relationship between Catwoman and Batman is kinda slimy and male-centric. Catwoman, while great as a character, functionally falls to Batman's controlling force with a forced romance in the second act. Sure they're both suffering from trauma but Batman was literally using her despite it all, it at least understands the power gap more in the third act.The end of the second act also spins its wheels a bit too much, the mystery pace kinda suffers a bit from focus and scenes get too drawn out (Riddler just disappears for a while). The movie could've been 20 minutes shorter. Doesn't stop it from having a terrific third act since most blockbusters have kinda sucked on that noteAlthough speaking of Riddler, master class. Probably my favorite villain in a Batman film. The aesthetic was gorgeous. I love its color grading and architecture, still thinking of the Wayne tower and its metal grates, goth hallways, and insane attention to detail that gets blurred out intentionally in the frame for most of the movie by Bruce's obliviousness to the world. It also keeps a balance of evoking the black/white movies while still being colorful, more of flooded black and oranges. I think of that sequence with Penguin not mainly for the fight itself (which to me was a bit messy) but moreso the flooded orange of the fire being the only color creating a sorta gradient on the black car, and how the flare at the end matches that aesthetic, that one color illuminating Batman leading everybody else to exit the frame, like a light in the darkness. LovelyThe music.... Giacchino just beat out his Incredibles score for me, masterful work with motifs, percussion, and rhythm. His mastery of percussion and horns during the lights out Batman hallway fight and how the horns blast, how well edited the percussion beat subtly goes through the Penguin chase and other fight sequences, Batman doesn't quite have a dance like Hong Kong films but the music makes it come close. The timpani and strings are so well used!!! Great use of Ave Maria both as soundtrack and score. Catwoman's motif? Amazing.The performances are great all around. Finally a film with Turturro that I don't hate him. He's well restrained and perfectly cast, his dickish attitude now a strong point making him very memorable with very little screen time, much like Farrell in the same film. Kravitz made me the closest to tearing up with how she visually handles conflicting emotions, I still think about that scene with the voicemail where her eyes are all over the place and has trouble keeping it all together. Dano as Riddler is terrific.Yep, this is my fav Batman film now.",414906,Tatsky,8.0,Positive
"This film is so intricate, there's so many details, things you can obverse on multiple watches and not have noticed on your first. There's a lot of things that just aren't spoken that give this film so much substance. So many layers and nuanced story telling. Gotham City feels as it should, as it's own character and a visceral cesspool of corruption and just dirt. It feels dirty, unpolished... it's amazing.There's so many shots in this film that are just simply breathtaking and intentionally dirty. It helps capture this visceral tone and fits substantially well with the universe of Batman.Being a diehard fan of Batman for, like, pretty much all of my life- I have to say; Matt Reeves absolutely nailed it with a completely faithful adaptation of Batman. Not once in this movie did he do something I felt was completely out of character and Robert Pattinson solidified the performance of both Bruce Wayne and the Batman. I love Matt Reeves went to the extent to make sure this Batman doesn't kill, as other directors have seem to give less care to. Yes, even Nolan. It should have to go without saying that Batman does not kill, that's a no-brainer, but for decades this has been a problem in Batman films... and finally, it no longer is a problem. That's how you do it.Bringing this review to a conclusion, this is easily my favourite Batman film. So many things about this film just feel like it's pulled straight out of a comic book. I mean, Riddler flooding the city itself is pulled straight from Zero Year and there's so many nods to comic moments and members of Batman's rouges gallery. Matt Reeves knew what he was doing, and he crafted this film for diehard Batman fans, succeeding immensely. Can't wait to see more of this universe.",414906,aquiluus,10.0,Positive
"Good albeit not great, this newest incarnation of Batman is well done if not also incredibly dark. I did like Robert Pattinson's portrayal and didn't employ the annoying voice that kind of ruined The Dark Knight and more so, The Dark Knight Rises. As a whole though I did like the plot (parts inspired by The Long Halloween) and a good supporting cast, with Paul Dano giving a creepy performance as The Riddler and looking forward to seeing more from Zoe Kravitz's Selina/Catwoman. **4.0/5**",414906,JPV852,8.0,Positive
"I am so tired of superhero movies. Still, being down with a mild case of Corona, I wanted something to watch that'd go down easy, and The Batman was available, so I picked it.I have to say that this, to me, is one of the rare superhero movies that appeal to me. And that's after having seen every other Batman movie since Tim Burton's 1989 one. And, I dare say, even with me being fed up with superhero movies, I think this is the best attempt.At three hours, it feels like binge-watching a three-part miniseries. And by that I mean both that to the extent that it is three acts, they almost perfectly align with an hour each, and also that the pacing is great, and I never got bored.The cast is excellent. Also, for the first time ever, I'm not thinking that it's ridiculous that no one recognizes Bruce Wayne as Batman. The half-mask actually makes Bruce Wayne unrecognizable. I'm not sure if they thought of that during casting, but it's really quite impressive.It's also nice to not have to suffer through a pathetic attempt from Batman to make his voice sound cool. Oh dear, Christian Bale trying to look and sound cool was just so cringey. Robert Pattinson is by far the best Batman I've ever seen. The almost depressive mental torment he conveys does not come off as fake or pretension, and that's a first for the Batman franchise as far as I'm concerned.The mood is bleak without being depressive, the score is fantastic, if a bit too much, the cinematography is amazing, I really have very little to fault here. If anything, it may come off as a little pretentious and self-indulgent, but that's also part of the attraction, and if I'm being completely honest, I think it's more to do with my own ""people need to grow up and stop watching these childish things"" prejudice I have, when in fact the 15-year-old inside of me f...ing loves it, and I need to embrace that childish part of me rather than hate on it.If there's anything I would change about this movie, it's what I feel is somewhat of a PG-ification of Batman. I would love to see this movie with all its bleak desperation and lust for vengeance on the depravity and evil in the Gotham world, but with a seriously anti-hero, all-violent, bringer-of-death Batman. I would love to see him - in a more crude outfit, with less bells and whistles, and definitely without the cape - destroy, slay and kill, with exploration of the terrible aftermath it would bring, including the impact on his psyche, rather than the beat-up-and-let-go strategy that he is using in this movie. That part just feels to not align with both the doomish mood that sets the story and the seeming existential depression of our masked protagonist. I think that would warrant yet another installment in this franchise. I'm actually surprised how much meat there is on this character.Also, if the movie overall is consistently a bit too much, the ending takes it one notch further on that scale.Regardless, I now have two superhero movies that I keep in my movie collection. The other is Watchmen (Director's Cut).1 star deducted for Catwoman being racist without it being presented as a problem. The casting of her is perfect, by the way. Much better than Michelle Pfeiffer.",414906,Horseface,7.0,Positive
"Oh boy, yet another review here on TMDB about this movie. What is it about comic books that garners so much interest? I am no longer a comic hero fan, either in movies or the source comic books. I have seen some of the Marvel series and the only one that I would watch multiple times if it came across my screen in Ant Man and the Wasp, with its wit, action and humor.I did read superhero comics as a kid, however. I stuck to DC comics. I especially liked the Legion of Superheroes, though I also read the Justice League, Superman and Batman. This was the Silver Age of comics, I believe, before they restarted and complicated the field with reimagining the comic universe (or whatever it is they did).Anyway, I was a DC boy so I gave The Batman a look see. It is a dark film, both in its themes and its camera work. No wit and humor to speak of here, just grim and introspective comic book noir. But it was intriguing and interesting enough to hold only my attention. There were a couple of interesting twists on traditional Batman villains, for example. As with a lot of current thrillers, there is quite a body count, when sometimes with violence, I think less can be more.It is not a film I will watch multiple times or anxiously await a sequel for, but I do not regret the time spent watching it.",414906,narrator56,8.0,Positive
"_The Batman_ is the best live-action Batman movie yet. It's the type of Batman film I've been waiting for my whole life.It's dark and realistic, but also stylish and large-scale. It's not limited by a commitment to realism like the Dark Knight trilogy, nor is it burdened by a shared universe like the DCEU. It is its own thing. A moody, disturbing, visually stunning, David Fincher-inspired, three hour long detective epic with some of the best interpretations of the characters ever put on screen.Robert Pattinson is fantastic as a younger, moodier, and yes, more emo Batman. Paul Dano is straight up terrifying as the Riddler. Colin Farrell is unrecognisable in more ways than one as The Penguin and Zoë Kravitz is easily my favorite live-action Catwoman. Massively underrated is john Turturro as Carmine Falcone.This movie kept me hooked all the way through. It's almost three hours long but it feels like two.This is the best Batman movie. The Dark Knight is good and all, but Reeves finds the perfect mix of gritty realism and style (Nolan would never even dare to have a snorricam shot of Batmam gliding over the city), and finally gives us a live-action Batman that lives up to the title of ""World's Greatest Detective"". Not that there's much competition, since he's like the only one to actually do any detective work (no, Christian Bale magically finding a fingerprint on a broken bullet doesn't count).",414906,mahmus,10.0,Positive
"To be honest, this is a really good movie. Hang on? So why did I only give it 2 out of 5 stars? Well, this is really personal but, to me, it is not a good Batman movie. I really had problems writing this review because it is a very good movie. I just did not like it as a Batman movie.The movie is really dark, gritty and noir. Not really a problem. It works for some movies. But it is also quite slow at the beginning and the first quarter of the movie was actually boring. Remember, this is a three hour movie so a quarter is more than half an hour of “boringness”.The “boringess” was broken up by a pretty cool car chase. Some people seem to not really like the batmobile and I have to say that it was not very inspired but it was not all bad either. Unfortunately the movie turned rather boring for a while again after that.The movie tries to bring out more of the detective part of Batman than the previous movies, which is fine, but there is just too much moping around with Batman / Bruce Wayne walking around oozing sadness all around him.Actually, this brings us to my main gripe with this movie. The choice of actor for the Batman is just wrong for me. He is more like a sad puppy than the Batman. The script that makes him mope around, have emotional outbreaks and, occasionally, being downright stupid like just staring dumbfounded when explosives go off in his face does not really help of course.To me the Selina Kyle character had more charisma than the Batman, especially when the Batman was in his Bruce Wayne alter ego.And I really, really dislike that twist about Bruce’s parents. That was such a lazy Hollywood writer hack thing to do just to create (unwanted) drama.Then we have the Riddler. Compared to the charismatic villains that we have come to expect he is just a sad little psychopath with a bunch of equally sad fanatical internet followers.Now, all of this would have worked great if it had been a movie about some, unspecified, vigilante. The movie is really well done. The detective story, the action (especially towards the end) and the noir setting would have worked great. Even at its three hour bloated length it would have been great although cut down to two hours or a bit more would have been even better. If it had not been a Batman movie!",414906,Dark Jedi,4.0,Negative
"This was the worst Batman I have ever seen. Firstly, Robert Pattinson was the worst choice for the Batman role. In Twilight he was alright, but in Batman he definitely failed. He was more like a sad, depressed goth kid with no emotions. He tried too much to fit the role, but in fact we got this depressive, dead and empty Batman. Secondly, there were other small things that sucked about this movie, for example, Cat Woman had a very simple and stupid mask. Even older movie versions had a better mask than here. Batman's batmobile also sucked. Looked like a downgraded version. He also rode just a simple bike and lastly, he couldn't even glide with his default Batman suit. Also, don't know why but James Gordon was played by a black actor, while in every movie and even in every game this character is white. Riddler character also seemed stupid, wearing stupid mask and acting stupid and wasn't intimidating at all, but laughable. So, in general cast and acting was disappointing in this movie.Lastly, the movie itself... It was dull, boring and depressive. They tried to make it masterpiece with 3 hours long, but in reality movie became just plain boring and I almost fell asleep. Overall verdict: Disappointing.",414906,Ditendra,3.0,Negative
"First of all, let me say that I enjoyed the first Doctor Strange along with many other projects Benedict was involved in, but this one removed all the sanity and introduced horrific and woke garbage that simply destroyed this movie for me. Somehow they managed to take a perfectly acceptable character and transform it into crazy madness and barbaric nonsense. Even those initial stumbling blocks I could have gotten past, but Disney decided to interject their woke garbage into this movie like many other new shows which has now put them on a blacklist for so many others like me. Not sure I would ever pay or even 'watch for free' anything by this company again, but that is me. I have standards, and clearly Disney is determined to brainwash their viewers with woke trash. So (for me) this movie doesn't move the needle, in fact I consider it a waste of my time. 🧻🚽🪠🚫🤮",453395,itsogs,1.0,Negative
"I really like Doctor Strange and i really liked the first Doctor Strange movie. So of course I was worried that Marvel being Marvel would screw this one up with their usual woke nonsense or just a substandard Hollywood writer hack script as they too often have done.Fortunately that was not the case. I quite liked this one.The movie is a CGI special effects feast of course. That is really one of the main reasons to watch this movie. However, Benedict Cumberbatch is really great as Doctor Strange as well.The movie has a half decent story. As good as you could expect from a Marvel movie. As usual it is a mix of action, suspense and comedy relief and Marvel has actually managed to get a decent balance in this movie. Doctor Strange stays competent throughout the movie and although Wong is sometimes a bit silly it is not too bad. There is little of the unintelligent slapstick “comedy” that Marvel sometimes pollute their movies with.I have to say that the main bad guy, Wanda the Scarlet Witch, was a bit mediocre though. Sure, when she let loose with her magic it was generally cool but, to me, she lacked real bad guy charisma.At times the movie became a rather violent actually. Although there was no real gore in it, the way Wanda disposed of some of the heroes in the alternate universe was somewhat brutal. Also the alternate universe undead Doctor Strange was almost horror movie material.The bottom line, for me, is that overall this was a very good movie.",453395,Dark Jedi,9.0,Positive
"Man all the people that went into this to watch a Doctor Strange movie are going to be angry aren't they?This isn't about Doctor Strange, well, it is if you make Doctor Strange into a bumbling idiot. This is about Woke Captain America, Amerigo Chavez, the biological daughter of two Lesbian women who is the center focus of this backdoor pilot.And it is about Wanda, who did horrible things and was instantly forgiven because girl power... or something... or Woke or whatever. But don't expect to see the Sorcerer Supreme in this, you know given that since Strange was already stripped of that title because he is problematic and they couldn't let him retain it, but then, don't expect to see that much of Strange either.",453395,GenerationofSwine,1.0,Negative
"What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor. 'Top Gun: Maverick' is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' [unexplained] absence.Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.",361743,r96sk,9.0,Positive
"Haven't seen a movie this perfect in decades. It was most obviously written and directed with the audience in mind - no politics, no preaching, no gratuitous sex, no woke, no offensive casting or characters. Brilliant, simplistic screenwriting and thrill rides. The original, if you've seen it, was iconic as it was, and to know it makes the second film here more enjoyable, but even if you're not familiar with the background of the characters it's clearly presented enough to be a stand-alone enjoyable film.",361743,JustEntertainment,10.0,Positive

"**Wanna see the real cheesy, very 80s, bloodpumping, blockbuster movie? a movie that can lift your mood without being to complicated? a movie that can make you feel immerse in movie theaters?**Say no more fam, cuz i presents you one of my favorite in 2022TOP GUN MAVERICK_**""Set 30 years after its predecessor, it follows Maverick's return to the United States Navy Strike Fighter Tactics Instructor program (also known as U.S. Navy-Fighter Weapons School - ""TOPGUN""), where he must confront his past as he trains a group of younger pilots, among them the son of Maverick's deceased best friend Lieutenant Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw, USN.""**_—WrathzoI never thought, a sequel from 80s hits movie would be exceeding its predecessor. tbh i thought this movie would be suck and will be getting the fate like The Matrix Resurrections and RoboCop remake. But boy i was wrong, this movie is the definition of Awesomeness in Cinema.Let me start with the Story. This movie doesnt have any complex story and some of it structure if im looking at it, kinda almost the same as the first one. But is it identical? yes? so it means they just copying it? no. what i mean is Peter Craig did take a few ideas from the first movie for a few scene (i think its a homage for the first movie) but the context has alot more meaning than the first one tbh.Now Scoring, Lorne Balfe did great job for remaking the Top Gun Anthem... Damn it feels good hearing that theme again... and also, i want to applause Onerepublic and Lady Gaga for creating such an awesome soundtrack for the movieNow lastly for cinematography and visual effect, its probably the first time in my life i got out from IMAX and said ""i paid 10$ dollar for this movie? i feel like i should've paid more. This movie is too good"". The sound design, the real action from fighter jet, the bloodpumping visual. It all works together creating this masterpiece. its been a decade since i feel this immerse on the movie.**In conclusion, ill keep this shortThis is the reason why Movie Theatre was created, now go watch it on IMAX.

"You're not supposed to like this, very literally. IMDb will block your reviews of this movie if you praise it. Amazon (owned by the same company) is fudging the like ratio, and Youtube did the same with the trailer.That makes sense. It really does.Maverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot. The white guy isn't evil. America isn't evil. It's a sequel that doesn't trash the heroes of the first film or attack the fans.From start to finish it's just a solid apolitical action movie.So of course you are supposed to hate it, it literally breaks all the rules of modern Hollywood.And that was why it was the biggest blockbuster of the past few years. That is why it had returns that would be a mega-bock buster pre-COVID. It's the type of movie that people actually want to see, which is why it's under attack on certain sites. You're not supposed to know that people like it and they weren't supposed to make a movie that people wanted to see.Everything has to be a propaganda piece. But you want to know a secret? If this came out in the 80s it wouldn't have done well. It's not as good of an action movie as they had back then. It actually sort of sucks compared to a lot of the classic action movies of this genre.But then it came out in 2022 and the rules have all changed. Today everything is racist or far left. So what you have here is a movie that is great... by 2022 standards... simply because it's not the crap that Hollywood is shoving down your throats and demanding that you like.",361743,GenerationofSwine,10.0,Positive
"As usual for the MCU, 'Thor: Love and Thunder' is a good watch. I did want more from it, though.Chris Hemsworth remains the star of the show, I'm adding nothing new by saying he is just perfect for the role. Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi and Natalie Portman all make for good support. Christian Bale is also someone I enjoyed, I like the look of his character but kinda felt that I wanted to see more of him - it's like we see a beginning and an end, but part of me feels like we coulda had something in-between.The special effects are solid, as is the music; even if the track choices aren't the most creative. I probably would've shortened the run time a little, though that isn't anything all that noteworthy to be honest. There are some funny moments in there, which is always something I expect from a Taika Waititi flick.As for me and my own personal Thor ranking, this - like the 2011 original (also 3*) - isn't one of my favourites (fwiw, I enjoy 'Thor: The Dark World' and 'Thor: Ragnarok' (both 4*) way more) but it's still a fun enough time that I'd recommend it.I simply cannot (cannot, I tell you!) believe they didn't just call this 'Thor Four' btw... 💔",616037,r96sk,7.0,Positive

"It appears that disgraced asshat Bob Chapek (not going to link to IMDb for this asshat since his bio there is just corporate gibberish written by Disney themselves, and not updated to show that he got fired) has scared away any form of actual talent from Disney so that even when they do something that is not blatantly woke and preaching it still turns into a turd.Already in the first scenes I was going what the f… is this? Are they turning the franchise into a comedy?Thor himself has been turned into a rambling moron. The rest of the Gods are either unbelievable assholes or fat slobs only caring about their orgies or some combination thereof. Most of the movie I was just cringing in my seat.If they were actually going for more of a comedy movie than an actual Thor movie they failed miserably. The “jokes” where unfunny, unintelligent and just bad. Superhero slapstick at best.The only character that I found remotely likable and cool in the movie was King Valkyrie. Jane Foster was not too bad either. The rest was just a joke. The portrayal of the mighty God Zeus and Olympus was an affront. The bad guy was not too bad although I would not call him likable of course. He is not supposed to be likable. At least he was not turned into a parody.It is really a shame because the underlying story is not half bad… if it had been given to someone with actual talent to implement. It is predictable of course but it is okay. If it had only been given to someone who could have turned it into a real Thor movie instead of this failed comedy turd.I have to admit that I did not have my hopes up very much when starting to watch this movie. Given what Disney has turned into I was afraid that they were literally going to turn Thor into a female and luckily that did not happen. Unfortunately they found another way of ruining the franchise. This movie is nothing like the previous Thor movies. I really liked Thor: The Dark World for example. To me this movie is very close to a franchise killer.The one and a half stars is for the special effects. They were pretty good. The rest of this movie is really bad.",616037,Dark Jedi,3.0,Negative
"I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.",315162,ravundwa,10.0,Positive

Isn't this sort of the opposite of everything that current Hollywood stands for?Where is the strong female lead replacing Puss in Boots as the hero? Where are the identity politics? Where is the nonstop shaming of Straight White Men? Where is the depiction of half the country as absolute evil? How can they make a western movie that doesn't shame the west at every possible turn?I have absolutely no idea how this could have been made, but what I can say is that it is fantastic, it is moving, it is fun for the whole family and it has a decent nonpolitical message. The main character is heroic. This is just... well, this is a movie that doesn't seem like it could possibly be made in today's Hollywood.",315162,GenerationofSwine,10.0,Positive

"Full review: open.spotify.com/episode/3MS52tXr7jHbZxxWsx62tO?si=1554552c2fb542cdI came into this movie with some apprehension due to how much I enjoyed the original Predator movie from 1987. My biggest concern was would they ruin the legacy left by the original movie, mostly due to the fact that this is a prequel, unlike the other's in the franchise. However, I was pleasantly surprised.There is so much to like about this movie, from its beautiful scenery, the highly entertaining action sequences, the stellar acting (led by Amber Midthunder) and how it actually paid homage to the original. The story, much like the original was simple and got straight to the point, and it didn't overcomplicate anything with lengthy or unnecessary dialogue. It also didn't do overboard with the easter eggs and references. I really cant excuse movies which make you pause to show off references to previous instalments of the franchise, even at times when they dont make sense. This movie did none of that which was refreshing.I highly recommend this movie. If the younger generation was to watch movie first and follow up with the original from 1987, it would not be a disservice at all. Looking forward to the sequel to this and seeing how they tie in more of the predator lore.",766507,d54.pod,8.0,Positive

"So this is a movie about Strong Female Lead, and though Strong Female Lead isn't a hunter and it seems like she hasn't really gone out hunting before, she is the bestest of the bestiest hunters ever. And the village is wrong for not letting her be the hunter and the lead of the hunting party because not recognizing her untested bestiest is wrong.And then she goes out and puts everyone at risk to prove that she is the bestest hunter ever... and she is, effortlessly, because she is a Strong Female Lead.And then Strong Female Lead encounters the Predator, and does something that was actually cool and pretty unique for the series. But then the Predator has to go kill off the rest of the hunters in her tribe for not recognizing that she is the bestest hunter ever.Only this is a politically correct movie, you can tell by Strong Female Lead, so the Predator can't be the bad guy, there has to be more of a political message. And because of that the plot adds in white people, who are the real evil, the evilist of the evil. The bestest of being evil. And they have to show that even when an alien is out there hunting people, white people are worse.And Strong Female Lead has to prove that she can be even better than them too without trying, and then proves it without expending any real effort.And out of the blue one of her hunting party (who are now not as evil because there are white men who are eviler) is allowed to do something actually sort of heroic because he doesn't have to be bad at everything now because they white people can be.And them 'Member Berries.And at the end Strong Female Lead proves to everyone that she is the bestest at everything, without needing to try, by virtue of just being the bestest of the bestest at everything without even needing to know what she's doing.yeah... you get the point, you've seen a thousand other movies just like this one since 2016.",766507,GenerationofSwine,1.0,Negative

"> _""My powers are not a gift. They're a curse, born out of rage.""_I had a blast watching this in theaters. This was very bombastic, with a lot of cool action, but also telling a heartfelt story about Black Adam.It was very inventive how they depicted Black Adam's origin, keeping it a mystery up near the end. Dwayne Johnson was born to play Black Adam. He steals every scene he's in playing a badass anto-hero.Now the Justice Society, while they didn't have a backstory in the film, they each had prequel comics detailing their backstory. Which I really dig, these comics are meant to sell comics, after all. Might as well get the audience to buy the comics to get into some great stories (they are also currently doing this with The Flash). The movie actually starts right where the Doctor Fate prequel comic ends, so I don't think it's apographa. Doctor Fate played by Pierce Brosnan was a standout. He really put his all into this character. Aldis Hodge was also a standout as Hawkman.The surprise villain of Black Adam, Sabbac, was a really good addition to the Shazam! mythos. If the wizards have their own champion, why doesn't the seven deadly sins have one? Sabbac is the answer to that. Doctor Fate's battle with him was really cool.Overall, this wasn't as bad as the critics were saying, I had a fun time!

"In all honesty, I was anticipating the same old rubbish. Neither the teaser nor the people involved left me feeling optimistic. To my surprise, I got a rather well-crafted superhero film that, despite its imperfections, is still superior to the vast bulk of its genre’s offerings in recent years. Coming from the DCEU, which has produced some of the most inconsistent content in recent memory, and starring Dwayne Johnson as the lead, who, apart from his charm and muscular physique, isn’t exactly known for his acting talents. In many respects, “Black Adam” had more going against it than for it.Nevertheless, thanks to director Jaume Collet-Serra, writers Adam Sztykiel, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani, and a supporting ensemble that makes the most out of a script that is at best passable, “Black Adam” manages to stand out from the recent run of lacklustre comic book films. It manages to establish a broader universe without appearing forced while introducing some new concepts to the genre. “Black Adam’s” most distinctive characteristic is the way it refuses to settle for any clear-cut morality. It all adds up to a film that succeeds more often than not.In 2019, when the Infinity Saga ended, you couldn’t have convinced me that I’d be more interested in the DCEU than the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But fast-forward three years, and that is precisely what has happened; DCEU has produced some good content during that time (Zack Snyder’s Justice League, The Suicide Squad, Peacemaker).

"OK, this isn't a bad movie. But, it as a bit much CGI (like everything else nowadays) and I think modern audiences are getting tired of paying out the wazoo to basically watch a video game.And then the narration. The voice is too young and though it does make sense with the plot, it is jarring because basic tradition is that narrations have an older and wiser voice... Morgan Freeman, Spock, etc. So that is going to instantly set the radiance off.And then the Snyderverse is over. Period. They made no illusions about that, we have known it was over for years, there was even a massive backlash about his cut of Justice League because it was given the fans what they wanted and thus bad... because politics and politics have declared that people that are enthusiastic about anything that isn't left wing politics are evil.Because the world has gone insane.But the greater point is that people already don't care. They not only already don't care, but they were sort of told not to by the very people that made the movie. It's world is over. This world ended before it was released.Which, sucks, because Shazam was my favorite to come out of the DCEU.People aren't going to care. They aren't going to watch it and when they do it's going to come with disdain.But as far as a Superhero movie goes... come on, you're not really getting much. They aren't Chinatown, they are just popcorn munchers and nothing more, and that isn't bad. But let's call it what it is.Unless they are political like the MCU, they are just mindless action and gags. And if they are political like the MCU, they sort of stink.This is relatively politics free. It's high on adventure and so-so on action (see the above CGI comment) so you have a decent film for the genre. It just should have come out before they declared the universe dead.",436270,GenerationofSwine,10.0,Positive
"Chadwick Boseman is undeniably missed, but 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' still manages to produce an entertaining and even touching final chapter of the MCU's Phase Four.I had a positive time with this, one good thing about watching it almost two months after release is that I got to watch this in an empty cinema - absolute bliss. Thankfully I managed to avoid all spoilers, though had heard the name Namor bandied about online so that's all I knew coming into it.Speaking of Namor, I'm a fan. He makes for a cool new character to the universe, as does Talokan as a whole, with Tenoch Huerta a welcomed addition to the cast - first time I recall seeing him in something, and I'm impressed. The star of this 2022 flick, however, is Letitia Wright. I don't really remember her standing out in the original much, at least to me, but here Wright is excellent.Angela Bassett is very good also, there's one emotion-filled speech scene in particular that stands out in my memory. Danai Gurira is always a joy to watch, while Winston Duke and Lupita Nyong'o are the best of the rest - though, the whole cast are good; even Martin Freeman, who I'm not always convinced by.The film handles Boseman's absence nicely, there are some very touching moments in there. I'd say they went the correct way with the character of T'Challa, no-one would've been able to even closely replicate Boseman. The music, meanwhile, is pleasant.I do think this has some relatively minor pacing issues, mainly around the midway point, but other than that I felt more than satisified with what I had just watched when leaving the cinema.

"I want to first state that I am absolutely thrilled about how Wokely pro-racism this, I mean it's 2022, the worst year in cinematic history, but I didn't think the Woke corporate overlords would go to this racist extreme. This is some repugnant crap and if I didn't know better, I would think that they were trying to go full Blazing Saddles and spoof racism.... but alas, it is Disney, and Disney is woke, the racism here isn't satirizing the subject, it's embracing it in all it's evil glory.Let's start with how they castrated Namor and then move on to utterly and completely they stereotyped Latinos, right down to focusing on how wet his back is and beating him by drying off his wet back.As if that wasn't racist enough it goes on to make it's prideful support of Black Nationalism clearly stated, the opposite of which we call White Nationalism, which is very much the purview of groups like the Neo-Nazis, KKK, and other hate groups. Wakanda Forever has done an excellent job of embracing that same ideology for the Black people of the world... and claiming it as a sort of pride.And that, of course, is exemplified by their virtuous victory over the forces of... Latino, who are so overtly masculine, right down to their shameful gendered language (like about 90% of the other languages on the globe) that they had to edit out Namor's bulge in order to... what... show more African Racial Superiority over the Latino population, or maybe just to add corporate feminism to the Black Nationalist message.Either way, the statement they made here was clear, Latinos bad, Black Nationalism good...... God I can't wait until racism is something that is shunned across the board again, because the people who like this crap deserve all the respect we give to the people that loved the original Birth of a Nation and rode around the south wearing sheets on their heads.I expected a healthy dose of Black Nationalism when I walked in, I even expected the in your face male-hating... but I thought the racism was going to be directed at people like me, you know, white people.

If you are one of the woke intellectual midgets watching the movie I am sure you could find some contrived way of construing some message out of it but normal people will probably find it rather woke free.Overall it was a pretty decent movie actually. Lot and lots of special effects and action of course and, as with Black Adams that I just reviewed, that is the main reason to watch this movie.Unlike Black Adams, the story as a hole has more Hollywood nonsense in it though. It is good enough to propel the movie from start to finish but that is all.The main plot of the movie is unfortunately one of those nonsensical bits. Not even a kid (actually she is not really a kid but an adult) having the misfortune of attending one of those depraved grooming and indoctrination institutes they call schools today would be stupid enough to hand over a detector that would put their African home nation in such grave danger.Then there was that illogical rant from the Queen where she, in a emotional fit, fired her best (only) General. The cognitively impaired sock puppet might do a thing like that but not a real regent.The part with the French in the UN was also utter rubbish. That was to please the Chinese, who are the ones that would actually do what the movie claimed the French were doing, and nothing else.Anyway, it is still a decent movie. Certainly a lot better than quite a few Marvel/DC movies that Hollywood has produced over the last couple of years. The special effects are very nice and most of the action is quite cool.I am somewhat concerned that they picked that rather non-charismatic and overly emotional woman to become the next Black Panther though. After all, she could have re-created the magic flower a lot earlier but instead she let her stubbornness and emotions stand in the way. Not exactly qualities you would want in the Black Panther.",505642,Dark Jedi,7.0,Positive

" 'Jurassic World Dominion' is far from perfect, if just about entertaining to watch... kinda.I'm not fully convinced by it but I do think there's enough in there that's worth watching. There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing.Still, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard.The run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though.I'd love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise (is there much more to tell?) but there ain't no way Amblin/Universal are leaving this IP to collect dust, let's be honest.",507086,r96sk,7.0,Positive
"Wow. Genetically modified locusts. I hope Universal got a discount on the screenwriters... On the plus side, some of the effects were okay. The hero shots of the two franchises (Jurassic Park and Jurassic World) looked good. Otherwise this was a slug to get through and felt like the old guard and new guard were phoning it in.

"Well, the dinosaur special effects are quite decent. Unfortunately that is more or less the only reason to watch this movie.I really do not understand how the Hollywood idiots can decide to spend loads of money on special effects but not bother to get a decent story/script writer? I mean come on, the story of this movie is just another thirteen on a dozen “big companies are bad” story with dinosaurs thrown in.The story is convoluted to say the least and there is as much logic in it as you would expect from a Hollywood writer hack. Things more or less just happen and the “heroes” fight off one dinosaur attack after another on their way to the bad gay without ever tiring. And why the hell can Hollywood never produce a movie where the “heroes” doesn’t just stare like idiots at something until they are screwed?Idiotic nonsens like being able to train a dinosaur to home in on someone like a heat seeking missile and chase them forever after having pointed a laser marker on them for a couple of seconds is also the usual unintelligent Hollywood nonsense that just ruins a movie for anyone with anything like average intelligence.They brough back some of the old characters but they do not really help. The mostly act like they cannot wait to get paid and get out of there. Jeff Goldblum is his usual climate cult procelyte. I did not really like him in the first movie and he is even worse in this one. The bad guy totally lacks charisma. The only character I really liked was DeWanda Wise as Kyle Watts.It is really a shame to see another franchise destroyed by today’s Hollywood morons. I’ve been a dinosaur fan since I was a kid and when the first Jurassic Parc came out with real, life like dinosaurs it was just wow. But now, not even the special effects can save this movie. It is not a good movie, plain and simple.",507086,Dark Jedi,4.0,Negative

The editing and pacing, in particular, are brilliant.The onscreen talent are all fantastic, but Michelle Yeoh is still the absolute standout from this. What a performance! I could watch her in this role over and over and over. With that said, Ke Huy Quan (welcome back!) is awesome as well, as are Stephanie Hsu, James Hong and Jamie Lee Curtis. Everyone plays their part very, very well.All of the humour lands, with some parts being truly funny. It also manages to show supremely enjoyable action alongside a highly meaningful side too.

"“Everything everywhere all at once” is a joy to experience.A family, who’s business is currently being investigated for tax fraud, find themselves thrown into the realm of the multiverse in order to save existence itself.  Jamie Lee Curtis is the investigator challenged to gain answers to questionable tax deductions while Michelle Yeoh ( Evelyn Wang ) is tasked with providing those answers while being distracted by her husband Waymond ( Ke Huy Quan ) jumping from universe to universe. What ensues is a fun filled, emotional,  SCI FI adventure that keeps the audience guessing the probable outcomes throughout. The performances of the four main actors, who juggle with very different characterisations of the family members, are magnificent. The Standout performances however are from both Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan who not only showcase their martial art skills but also highlight their fantastic comic timing as they switch between different versions of their characters in each universe they visit. The optimism and love the central characters show to each other as well as others contrasts so well with the cold uncaring multiverse.

"This movie was pretty much what I expected or rather hoped for. It was a fun adventure/action rollercoaster plain and simple. This is one of those, rare nowadays, movies that are meant to entertain plain and simple. Two hours of adventure, action and twists barely held together by a rudimentary story and no woke rubbish or bullshit preaching. The latter is probably what rendered it a 40% rotten “critics” score on woke tomatoes while the audience gave it a 90% fresh score. As almost always a rotten score on woke tomatoes is an indication that it is a movie worthwhile watching.The story, as can be seen from the movie blurb, is a treasure hunt a la Indiana Jones. It starts off by introducing the main character, Nathan, in a few brief scenes where Nathan bungles up a heist being perpetrated by his brother after which they are involuntarily separated.Quick forward to present time and the main story takes off with Nathan being persuaded by Sullivan to embark on a hunt for an immeasurable treasure. Not exactly the newest or freshest of stories but if it works don’t fix it.Pretty much everyone in this movie is a self-centered scoundrel with little to no care for anyone except themselves. Thus the action and treasure hunting is regularly interrupted by twists and betrayals. No one will claim that this movie has an elaborate and intelligent story. It does not have to. It is just meant to hold the action together.I quite liked the main actors. Sullivan did a good job of being the blasé, self-centered scoundrel, Nathan of being the somewhat naive wannabe treasure hunter and Braddock was quite cool, and sexy (hey, I’m a guy), as the baddie. Antonio Banderas was Antonio Banderas although I was saddened by his premature exit from the hunt.Overall the action was nice although the scenes in, and out of, the airplane was the usual unrealistic Hollywood action. Although that was overshadowed with the ship carrying helicopter scenes towards the end which was taking unrealism to new levels. But I didn’t really care because it was fun silliness. The moment they started to carry those ships away I started to hope that the writer would go for the silly and obvious stunt involving black powder. Yes unrealistic but there is no denying the coolness factor.As far as I am concerned this was two hours well spent. The ending scene clearly suggested that the producers hoped to make a sequel. I would definitely watch it but with all the people lamenting the fact that someone dared to make a movie simply for entertainment without a profound (and boring) story or bullshit preaching in it that might not happen. It did make about four times its budget at the box office though so maybe.",335787,Dark Jedi,7.0,Positive

"This was a fund movie indeed, and quite woke-free at that. The fact that the woke crap site Rotten Tomatoes has marked it as rotten (despite it having more than 50% positive critics reviews) was a good sign of course.It is an action/comedy about an unbelievably unlucky (and a bit stupid) assassin played by Brad Pitt. The movie mixes action, comedy, a bit of suspense and a fair amount of gore in a quite enjoyable package.The movie balances the comedy bits right on the line where it would turn silly and cringe-worthy but there was really only one place where I went “Oh no, what the f…?”.The action bits are overall quite good but this is Hollywood with their armada of clueless script writers so sometimes they get a bit ridiculous. Like being able to hang on to the outside of a bullet train while it speeds away.Although fairly unbelievable and over the top, the core story actually makes some sense but then, it was not written by some Hollywood hack but instead based on a novel.Overall it was a fun movie with a lot of laughs.

"Nothing in this movie makes any sense. If he has to drink a bag of blood every 6 hours, why not just do so? The human populace of how many billion people can not sustain a single vampire? No, he makes and consumes artificial blood for ethical reasons. Who says he needs to kill or hurt people to get what he needs? Horrible premise for his actions, not believable at all. And the rest of the story is the same. Weird decision making, boring, pointless dialogue. The bad guy is suddenly bad lacking any morals because he was bullied once apparently. Vampire powers are a myriad of random things. One time he is able to fly and it is hard to determine why exactly, the movie suggests because a subway train is pushing the air in front of it.

But once in, he actually pulls off a very realistic doctor role that is also bitter on life due to his health. Of course, looking for the solution leads to the bigger story that you could probably guess by now. I'm also at a point where I'm ""over it"" with a lot of these superhero movies, so it was refreshing to see something different out of the MCU. If I did have any complaints, there are some unanswered questions at the end, but you know, that always leaves room for a sequel. However, on top of that, the two end credit scenes just add more ""Huuuh?"" and probably do more damage than good.Not the best movie ever, but a far reach from the worst as well.

"> **Jim Jones; Executive Chef**Going to a once-in-a-lifetime tasting at a restaurant headed by one of (if not _the_) most renowned chefs in the world sounds like a dream come true to any foodie. (Myself included, albeit vicariously via the Food Network) Two of these lucky guests are Tyler (played by **Nicholas Hoult**), and Margot (played by **Anya Taylor-Joy**).The issue is, something is already not right. No, it's not obvious; at least not to normal people like you and me. Elsa (played by **Hong Chau**) picked up on it, but she isn't like us. As more and more guest arrive, someone isn't supposed to be there... Ah, don't worry, the feeling will pass. After all, the tasting is just about to start...This is when we meet the executive chef, Chef Slowik (brilliantly played by **Ralph Fiennes**). At first he is charismatic and prepares his guest for each tasting with stories. But this little cult like bigrade eventually let on that they know more about their guests than anyone should... That is except for one. As someone who is enamored with the food world, seeing The Menu satire some of my favorite shows:* Netflix's Chef's Table with the course spotlight cinematography and ingredients cards.* Any Celebrity Chef (i.e. Chef Slowik calling someone a 'donkey', clearly a reference to Gordon Ramsey). ...I was delighted that this film leaned into the dark end of how service work can feel sometimes. This film feels cathartic having lived the life of a service worker, and I feel others who have had that experience should be able to connect to the darker parts of the film as well. The plot culminate in a theme that I think despite what mild morbidity was displayed, most watchers can relate; Be it society's expectations or our own, the more we push toward perceived greatness we run away from that childhood excitement that set up on the path to begin with. The Menu as a whole, is, well... Something you might hear at an actual tasting: A story of life, it's memories (good and bad) told in 5 courses. If you're part of the menu, you deserve to stay until the end... That is, unless your not supposed to be here; perhaps life hasn't beaten you down enough yet...

"“The Menu” takes anti capitalism and serves it up with a sprinkle or two of violence delivered on a plate by a perfectionist, cult leading chef.

As the guests arrive they are first subjected to a tour of the Island to see the produce used in Hawthorn being grown and sea food being gathered. Once seated in the restaurant the food begins to be served along with a story from head chef outlining the dish and its significance to the overall experience.  Before the final course is served the stories become darker and more extreme culminating in the diners becoming fearful for their own lives.  Before we reach the final course one sous chef announces that the menu requires “ an ending that ties everything together conceptually”. At this point in the proceedings it becomes clear that the restaurant staff are very much following the direction of their head chef without question, much in the way followers of any cult leader react.  “The Menu” is very unsettling and produces some uneasy, grimacing moments but balances them out well with enough humour and satire to make for a rather enjoyable experience.",593643,tensharpe,8.0,Positive
"This movie is not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. Without giving anything away, the plot is a unique one and the main villain's motivation is original, but the movie spoils everything by treating the audience like idiots.One example (and this _is_ a spoiler, albeit a small one, so skip this paragraph if you still want to watch the movie) is when one character gets his finger chopped off. This was because he told his wife he was going to 'handle' the situation, and one of the baddies responded by asking 'with which hand?' When he didn't reply, she said 'left hand, ring finger' and one of the other baddies proceeded to chop said finger off.Now that all sounds very clever (handle/hand - what a pun!) if you don't think about it too much, but if you _do_, you'll realize that the baddies had no way of knowing that that character was going to use the word 'handle', and yet removing his finger seemed to have been pre-planned. Were they going to do it anyway, and his use of the word was a lucky coincidence that allowed them to make a pun while doing it? Or in their meeting earlier, did they say ""at some point someone might use the word 'handle', at which point we're going to remove part of their hand""? I don't know, and some of you might say I'm being pedantic, but this movie was _full_ of things like this. It really took me out of it. 3/10, wouldn't recommend.",593643,Aaaidan,3.0,Negative
"I was expecting more from this movie, but it turned out to be a big disappointment.First of all Vikings in this movie were represented more like an animals, acting like a rabid animals rather than humans and Vikings we have seen in popular TV shows, but the reason why I'm giving such a low score to this movie is simple - boredom. Character development was poor. I didn't care for any of them. Story was a typical vengeance story, nothing special or unique and the movie itself was very slow, lacking action and I almost fell a sleep. At first it seemed a realistic movie, but then they started putting supernatural things, so it wasn't realistic, but wasn't a typical unrealistic movie (like Marvel and DC) either. It was just a poor attempt of mixed jumble. It's sad to see such a great actors wasted in this boring movie, but even they couldn't save it if script was so poorly written and executed.",639933,Ditendra,3.0,Negative

"It is a movie based on a Scandinavian legend called Amleth, and it was a major source of inspiration for Shakespeare the day he wrote the story of Hamlet. The movie tells the story of a young Viking prince who seeks revenge for his father's murder.Northman's movie is one of the most beautiful and best movies I've seen in 2022. This movie is amazing in the full sense of the word, despite the negative opinions about the movie.The atmosphere of the film and the way the story was presented was interesting. I enjoyed the stages of revenge that Prince Amleth did. I immersed myself in the world of The Northman from the first 10 minutes and forgot myself due to my vision of a brutal, miserable, cruel, barbaric and cold world, in addition to a strange mixture between realism, fantasy and hallucinations.The nice stuff about the movie is the mention of Norse mythology from Northsimology. If you want these characters, they are in the game The Lord of War.Director Robert Eggers, when he directs any movie, you find his touch and personality in the films he directs, such as The Witch 2015 and The Night House 2019. Robert paid great attention to details, and he wrote the characters beautifully and the dialogues that he writes in his films in a literary form, forming a rich dialogue, but at the same time You find it interesting.The combat scenes were wonderful and were directed beautifully. I have seen many long scenes, scenes that you see as very violent and bloody, and these scenes are difficult for the director to produce in a manner that calls for perfection, given that they require replaying dozens of times. The director knew how to attract the viewers' attention to the furthest limits.The acting of Alexander Skarsgård was excellent. I felt his psychological suffering, in addition to Anna Taylor. She is ingenious and is good at playing any role. If you ask her, if you give her to act as a standing tree, she will do it very well.",639933,Ahmetaslan27,7.0,Positive
"Full review: open.spotify.com/episode/03ZQLC8VjUeeMGuAIbVyTq?si=b217083aa90c4457Jordan Peele's 'Nope; comes in with some big expectations due to Peele's previous work. 'Get Out' shifted the paradigm for horror movies, taking a genre which has historically been associated with a temporary experience of thrill and adrenaline, to being social commentaries on society and raising some deeper questions about ourselves in the process of watching his stories unfold.Nope is no exception, and in fact it can be argued that it attempts to combine story, metaphor and meaning in a more ambitious way than his previous outings. Taking the central theme of 'spectacle', Peele beautifully illustrates its dangers and how we as a society are so obsessed with the spotlight to our own detriment (and even int he worst cases, eventual demise). Choosing a more science fiction approach this time around, Peele does a great job of story telling, and often subvert's out expectations time and time again in the process. Aside from the film's deeper meaning, some of the other highlights come in the form of the cinematography and performances from the central characters (mostly notably, OJ, Emerald and Angel). Peele has managed to create some complex characters which are highly relatable, and the chemistry between the actors is something which will be a lasting memory for me.However, I do feel that the film does sacrifice plot and narrative in its relentless effort to hammer in the metaphor of the central theme - 'Spectacle'. While I did enjoy each story (OJ and the Animal Alien and Gordie and Jupe), I had a hard time understanding the relationship they had with each other from a narrative point of view. It often felt like two stories could have been played out better without the interference of the other. Other than that I did have some questions around OJ's motivations to tame / kill this animal, the legitimacy of the final impossible shot, the nature and behaviour the animal, and how / if OJ survived (or was this open for interpretation?). The ending of the film also was a slight let down with the death of the animal not being all that grand. This however could also be tied into the overall message of 'Spectacle' as the finale is often not worth the what we expect it to be.Overall, I think Nope is a very good movie which will probably get better with a few re-watches to fully appreciate what Peele was trying to tell us.",762504,d54.pod,7.0,Positive
"Even if the story was kind of lackluster, the film itself was incredible. If you consider the tower as a kind of true main character of the movie. On first watching this I can instantly imagine the blustering cacophony of outrage about climbing technique from viewers. From the first, the film is rather jarring but honest about its juvenile depiction of ""climbing"". At the start I had to decide NOT to care about how realistic it was because it would be wrong to reduce a film abductio absurdum because it is a story after all. A creation. It isn't being judged on its ability to remind one of real life so much as to forget it. I do this 'forgetting' voluntarily and I seem to enjoy films more. I felt my body constricting away slightly and getting anxious during the gravity yawning scenes, 2000ft above the ground! The characters were reckless enough to believe they would die at almost any time. It was unrelenting in the tension. Even if the writing is kind of silly at times, there are elements in a film, perhaps shown through other mediums besides the writing itself that can raise the score of the film quite a bit. Consider the cinematography. The deft and skilled work at showing the tension existing in every moment by rattling bolts in close up with uncanny metallic sounds protesting the extra weight. The drone shots that highlight the mind bending fear of such a radical location. Honestly! It seemed like such a labor of love of the filmmakers. They immediately saw how much could be done with the location. The story felt like a vehicle for the film which was this awesome gigantic testament to the fear of heights. The movie poster sold this one for me because I was thinking, well, even if it isn't that good, the idea itself is good enough to be fascinating. Consider the main character of the movie: the tower itself. It said nothing the entire time, but it was the star of every scene. Such as it was, the story was like kind of this extra fluff that you had to deal with, but what a cool film. There was an amazing number of times I was 'triggered' by how silly and unrealistic the climbing aspects were, and how insanely reckless it became. However, I don't believe that anyone thinks this a film to be studying climbing from. It isn't even showing climbing's artistic nature which is the film's biggest pitfall. I loved how the arc centered around conquering your fears through this metaphorical path of climbing and I'm sure a lot of climbers embraced that, and were reminded of it, but it was a crime to leave out why the characters are pursuing this passion.",985939,ObjectivityGate,7.0,Positive
"**might contain spoilers**What a great murder mystery film. As an amateur climber, I too was initially put off by the amount of unprofessional climbing techniques. However, if they were truly climbing/solo enthusiasts, how could they not get injured way before they take on any big challenges? (And from a filmmaking perspective, with climbing being such a popular sports, surly it is not hard to get some random joe from the gym to tell the film crew that those techniques are horrible! also there are other suspicious common-sense defying points later…) The answer of course, what we watched is just simply a **recounting of Becky’s version of what transpired!!!** Then all the inaccuracies makes perfect sense as that’s how you get the authorities to believe why the “accidents” happened in the first place — sheer negligence and amateur skills!I believe what happened was that Becky found out that she was cheated on, then plotted to get rid of the asshat by either screwing with the cam placements and/or - as filmed but with a malignant intent - to get rid of the rope too liberally. And no one else knows exactly how good the cam placements are or whether they were tempered with - Hunter is way above them busy down-climbing!Then, this explains perfectly her year-long depression as even if not fully planned out, her imo premeditated actions naturally put herself in even deeper sense of guilt.Then there’s the forever unknowable fact that whether the tower trips is truly initiated by Hunter. Possibly Becky saw Hunter is living a guilt-free life and had another urge for murder and proposed to feed Hunter this great youtube/instagram clickbait trip to convince her to come along! Although the film depicts that Hunter is very heartwarming at times, it’s entirely plausible that Hunter **is** in fact the care-free personality that she demonstrates in **all her videos online!** (which might makes her more murderable in Becky’s eye). So Becky could be using a very high-IQ way of framing her victims as compassionate sweethearts.Finally, the biggest telltale sign that the final accident is premeditated (and possibly intended by the filmcrew/writer) is that when Becky lastly went for Hunter’s body to drop down the phone, she **instinctively — rightfully so for a climber** clipped the carabiner to the lowest stable point which is the as yet unbroken ladder!!!(and the film gave this a real good close-up) Why on earth wouldn’t Hunter do that when she went down to retrieve the bag???!!! This is not just bad climbing, this defies common sense! We were all screaming how stupid it was of Hunter to do what she did in the bag sequence and now we know, **these are all extremely likely fabrications recounted by Becky at the end of the accident!**Lastly, some keen chinese filmgoers also noted the “mistake” on the poster where in fact **the ladders are failing while Becky’s at the top and Hunter is still climbing!** Maybe this is a hint from the production team ;)**welp anyways it’s just a theory :p I probably watched too many asian sope-operas**",985939,levincoolxyz,8.0,Positive
"I can’t help having a soft spot for a movie that name-drops several pro wrestlers as a means to convey a nice bit of subtle foreshadowing, and plays Warrants «Cherry Pie» on its soundtrack like every five minutes.On the other hand, it’s very difficult to empathize with the characters in this film; anyone who climbs a rusty, super creaky 2,000 foot TV tower (a choice so inane that under normal circumstances it’s known as the Fallacy of the Climbing Villain) in the middle of bumfuck nowhere just for shits and giggles deserves whatever’s coming to them. The rationale, such as it is, behind the protagonists’ actions is that life is «too short» and «you gotta do something that makes you feel alive.» Methinks they’re confusing joie de vivre with having a fucking death wish. According to these people’s logic, Bobby De Niro and Chris Walken were really sucking the marrow out of life in those Russian roulette scenes from The Deer Hunter. Now, that climbing artificial structures (known as buildering as well as several other names) is a reckless (not to mention illegal) thing to do doesn’t necessarily mean that those who do it take it lightly. I’m sure a lot of planning and prepping and getting in shape mentally and physically (even the relatively simple act of climbing a ladder becomes a Herculean labor when the ladder is twice as tall as the Eiffel Tower) precedes the actual deed.We don’t see any of that here; not even a training montage. For Hunter (Virginia Gardner) and Becky (Grace Caroline Currey) it’s an overnight decision; sure, Hunter says she’s has «planned» it, and she’s some sort of daredevil You Tuber, but Becky is an out-of-practice rock climber who has ostensibly become a drunken slob in the year since her husband’s Disney Villain Death. All of the above notwithstanding, the film certainly makes the most of its chosen setting. The landscape around the top of the tower (consisting of a «pizza-size platform») betrays a green screen quality to it, but this is a rare occasion in which this actually works in the movie’s favor; at such dizzying heights, wouldn’t the world and everything in it look surreal? Or, to put it more bluntly, wouldn’t your perception get all screwed up? Moreover, the stunts don’t flat-out take your breath away, but they do kind of borrow it for a little while, which is better than nothing; also, there’s a certain measure of suspense regarding whether or not help is on the way — and while this is the only movie that I can think of where the audience is left literally waiting for the other shoe to drop, this aspect of the plot actually involves a pretty neat shot of, well, a shoe dropping.",985939,tmdb28039023,4.0,Negative

Though the majority of the film's slasher moments are near the end, the story's introduction and setup were surprisingly engaging. Watching the creation of M3GAN and the development of her relationship with the characters in the story was a great way of anticipating the moment she would take matters into her own hands.

"**It's an enjoyable film, it carries a pertinent anti-tech message, but it's not even close to being a horror film.**First, let me make one thing clear: horror movies have an imperative duty to scare and disturb us. Tension, suspense, fear and some scares are something that should not be missing. It's the essence of horror cinema, right? So, can someone explain to me where came from the bad idea of making horror movies for teenagers who aren't old enough to ride a motorcycle? Don't get me wrong… the movie is good, and I liked it, but I can't consider it a horror movie. It is not able to frighten anyone! It has no scares (we are able to predict them from a mile!), it has no tension or suspense. As a horror movie, forget it. As the people say, it rains, but it doesn't get us wet, do you understand?The script begins with a young girl who loses her parents in a tragic accident and goes to live with an aunt who works in a large corporation of highly technological toys. Things aren't easy and neither of them is prepared for the situation. It is in this context that we met M3GAN, a prototype of a toy that is, basically, an android child that is capable of learning, improving itself, teaching and, basically, replacing parents in the tiring task of… being parents. The problem is that, being a machine, it has no notion of good or bad, right or wrong, and that seems to have been a secondary detail in its programming. So it's no surprise that she quickly turns into a sly, cynical creature who kills without any remorse.The film was directed by Gerard Johnstone, an illustrious unknown. Who is behind the project is the producer and screenwriter James Wan, who we know from “Saw” and “Conjuring 2”. Wan's brand is everywhere. It would have been better if he had directed it and the project had evolved into a somber film, a true horror piece. Allison Williams does the main character well, giving us yet another excellent job. The actress is living a happy moment in her professional life after having shone in “Get Out” and seems to be managing to take advantage of the opportunities. Amie Donald and Jenna Davis, in turn, give body and voice (respectively) to M3GAN, complementing the work with an animatronic doll created for this purpose.The animatronic doll is nothing new. Cinema has used this technology for decades, and Spielberg's shark – one of the first and most infamous examples – is proof of that. However, the special effects and CGI are to be congratulated. The film utilizes a number of expensive visual and digital resources to excellent effect, wonderfully complementing what was done in the studio. The sound (particularly the sound effects related to the doll) also deserves praise, and the cinematography, even though it doesn't bring new or innovative features, makes the best use of it all. The film has good costumes and convincing sets, as well as a very good, modern and fun soundtrack. It's on the editing table that things go wrong: either because of the excessive length, or because it wants to target young age groups, the film was badly edited, and the cuts are rough. There are even scenes from the trailer that, because they are not in the final cut, make it difficult to understand the story: for example, the scene where Gemma orders M3EGAN to protect Cady, which appears in the trailer and was cut from the film, but which would help to understand why the doll starts to behave that way to protect its young owner.The only real fear that this film conveys is the credible possibility that, in the medium term, there will be some toy similar to M3GAN. Advances in AI, computing, robot creation and design, or other technologies make it plausible. Will it be that one day we will have robots and androids that, due to their characteristics, will be considered alive and, as such, immortal and, therefore, superior to the humans who created them? I don't think anyone wants to see that. Therefore, the film carries with it a message of distrust in technology, visible not only in M3GAN, but also in Cady's technological dependence. I can do nothing but applaud: the generations born after the year 2000 saw their childhood dominated by cell phones, iPads or computers, to the point of despising conventional games and toys and alienating themselves from living together, normal and healthy, with other children. I'm not making it up, this is a fact that we can all see in a short trip to any school. And if there are parents who appreciate the creation of devices that keep their children busy, I am in the group of parents who see technology as something that should be dosed in a more measured way, allowing children a normal childhood before introducing them to the digital and tech world. I think there is a time for everything in life, and childhood shouldn't be spent looking at screens and LCDs.",536554,FilipeManuelNeto,7.0,Positive
"A fascinating film with potential that was never fully achieved. “All Quiet on the Western Front” does not rely solely on shock value to disturb its audience; instead, it uses the horrors of war to sober them with facts and dismal realities. The film's story was worth telling; it left an impression long after the credits rolled. It dealt with many weighty themes, including a young man's journey through war, the difficulties of combat, the cruelty of desperation, and the value of friendship and camaraderie, all of which were handled with grace and artistry. Furthermore, it boasted first-rate production values, breathtaking visuals, a terrific score (although maybe a tad bit over the top), and stellar acting. Although there is much to praise about the film, “All Quiet on the Western Front” is ultimately hampered by its drawn-out length, the plot dragging in spots, and several confusing moments. All the pieces were in place for “All Quiet on the Western Front” to be the best picture of the year, and in some respects, it is.

"**Demonizing war leaders VS angel soldiers**One of the most beautiful and simple moments in the life of a person who loves cinema is watching this movie without any expectations and he comes out of this movie with a very high fascination. I was related to war events, especially World War I and World War II. Naturally, this thing made me related to war movies.From the beginning, simply this movie that we are talking about entered my list among the best movies I have seen in my life, and the reason is because it is different from any other movie.It is very ironic from the beginning of the film, and you see to what degree the name of the movie doesn't at all indicate that things are calm between the Germans and the French, but it is important that through the events of the film we will live the quiet and deadly events of the soldiers on the Western Front between the Germans and the French.You will live the events of this war from the perspective of young Germans, and you will see and discover that this giant evil devil in Europe, who is always blamed for all wars, whether World War I or World War II, is made up of young human soldiers in the prime of their lives, coordinated behind policies and resounding slogans. The most important point is that in every A war has victims and perpetrators on both sides.One of the most important advantages of the film is the German side, because you will live the events of the movie through German actors, and this is a precedent in war films for me, which will increase the realism of the film’s story. Despite my lack of knowledge of the German language, I decided to bring subtitle of the movie.We will live with multiple personalities from the moment German youths register for the army, through their entry into the battlefield, and you will see the long nights of war and many German youths who have simple aspirations and dreams, in addition to how true friendship will be formed between members of the army in this lonely place.The impact of losing friends during the battle in a sudden, brutal and realistic way. What I liked the most about the movie is the war aspect. My body shivered many times while watching it, because you usually see in traditional war movies you often find plans, strategies, battles and heroic stances, but this movie is like (1917 movie at 2019). We live with simple soldiers in the battle. The movie tells us the details of the horrors of the battle experienced by every soldier.The film succeeded in demonizing wars and war leaders, and at the same time humanizing all the soldiers present in wars.",49046,Ahmetaslan27,9.0,Positive

If you don't believe me find out how they teach history in German schools.

"Death on the Nile has a prologue set in World War I, where a young Hercule Poirot is played by a digitally ‘de-aged’ Kenneth Branagh. Et tu, Kenneth? If you must do this, why not get a younger actor who looks likes Branagh? Or even one who doesn’t look like the Northern Irish writer/director/actor, so long as he looks like an actual human being; it’s safe to say that Branagh looks neither like himself nor like a member of the human race (he actually looks less grotesque after an explosion disfigures one side of his face). Again, this is only if you must do this – but then, you mustn’t do it, especially considering that this prologue exists only, and I kid you not, as an origin story for Poirot’s mustache.In order to catch up with Branagh’s current appearance, the character then ages some 40 years in the space of about two decades, and in the interim it’s the world around him that has received a digital facelift – in particular Egypt, whose entire topography and everything in it, including flora, fauna, bodies of water, architecture, historical landmarks, etc., etc., has been computer-generated, and very crudely at that. They should have called this Death on Denial, because based on the evidence of this movie, the Nile isn’t a river in Egypt – or a river at all, nor Egypt a place that bears any resemblance to any known landscape that can be found on planet Earth.As for the actual plot, who cares? It's impossible to believe in the existence of these characters as real persons because they're all clearly actors standing in front of green screens, and the ""Death"" of the title is rendered meaningless because it takes place in a lifeless world. Even an Agatha Christie murder mystery – nay, especially an Agatha Christie murder mystery demands a plausible backdrop, and in that sense a matte painting, rear projection, miniatures, any number indeed of practical special effects would offer a much more tangible setting for this story – the next best thing, as a matter of fact, to actually shooting on location (which admittedly is not always feasible).",505026,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative
"Romance novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) gets kidnapped by billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). She is taken to an island where her archaeological skills are needed to find a treasure hidden in a lost tomb. Sage's cover model Alan (Channing Tatum), mercenary Jack (Brad Pitt), and Sage's publisher Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) try to come to Loretta's aid. This riff on ""Romancing the Stone"" and a few other Hollywood projects about writers shouldn't work this well. The screenplay credit is messy, but Bullock uses her impeccable comic timing to deliver. Tatum brings more to the ""dumb guy"" role than was required, Pitt should have had more fun with his pretty boy/mercenary role, and Radcliffe doesn't get lost in the shuffle. Harrison, as Sage's social media ambassador, steals her scenes from the name performers. Randolph is good, but like Pitt, I wanted more from her character. The Nee brothers' direction is heavy on technology. The color correction and lighting are harsh, and some of the special effects aren't convincing. The pacing has more fits and starts than my first used car, so when a running gag or set-piece lands, it's more successful than it should have been. Alan has a great scene with Loretta after she refers to her romance fiction as shlock, and he sets her straight about disrespecting the audience who loves her stories.

"write something honestAny movie directed by Darren Aronofsky contains a lot of violent scenes that are unfamiliar and hard on the eyes to see. Darren Aronofsky is a director whose work must be eagerly awaited because one of his films, Requiem of Dream 2000, is one of my favorites.The most important event in the movie The Whale is the star Brendan Fraser, after suffering from many health problems, especially with the spine, and was forced to perform surgeries, in addition to the withdrawal of lights and fame from him, and his playing movie roles that didn't achieve wide success.Brendan Fraser played a terrible role that deserves an Academy Award due to his genius performance, and you do not expect this wonderful acting performance from him, especially since he is an actor who is very good at comedy roles. He did a lot of dramatic work, but he didn't reach perfection like the one in the movie The Whale.This amazing drama was like a oneman show although the other actors did well but the main reason for my admiration for the movie is Brendan Fraser. It was the make-up and the way the breathing was unbelievable and it's mind blowing how someone can pull off such a roleThe film was shot in only one location, with the exception of the flashback scenes.

I've watched every scream since scream was invented. I like the first two okay but after that the kind of got a little iffy. This one really goes back to what screen was intended to be by Wes Craven. I really like the flow of this movie and how they put the twist on Samantha's character. It starts like the first scream and it ends like the first scream. I'll have to say out of all the scream movies this was one of the most decent and hardest to figure out.,646385,MonsterMartha,7.0,Positive
"After watching the movie, I thought that if I had watched it on a streaming platform I would wish I caught it in the cinemas. Luckily I watched it on an IMAX cinema so the screen was huge and the sound was great, dialague was loud and clear. It had an entense tone to it to keep my attention. There were jokes here and there, but nothing major to distract me at all. I liked that it starts a bit slow and builds up, the second half is what remind me why I go to the cinemas, non-stop action and greatly done shots that you wish to put on your computer screen. It's science fiction film that captivates your imagination. The plot and ideas I found very interesting. I enjoyed the movie, so I would recommend to catch it in the cinemas. Bigger cinema, the better. My only complaint is that it couldn't take advantage of the full IMAX screen that was available, probably due to budget constraints.",406759,tmdb81678279,9.0,Positive

Sure, Guillermo took a much bigger artistic license than Disney. So what?

"This is one of the most brilliant movies I've seen in a long time. I understand why some people might not fully appreciate the story (which reminds me of Aronofsky's Black Swan in that it's a painfully slow descent into Hell). I find this film as complex as a fine scotch, or a fine wine. The top note is, of course, the beautiful visuals created by Ben Davis. The acting all around is phenomenal. Farrell and Gleeson were, of course, nothing short of spectacular. The real surprise was the character created by Barry Keoghan. I couldn't help but be amazed by how real his character was. Although I was expecting the banshees to be like in the horror film I saw as a kid, I really appreciated the Shakespearean witch device. It was perfect in this context. The second note of flavor of this masterpiece is all about relationships in a closed community. If you ever lived in a condo, an association community or the like, you will recognize the day-to-day pettiness that everyone thinks is so important. A subtle addition to the complex layers of flavor is Burwell's perfect score. And the deep flavor of this movie? It is the parallel that the protagonists finally draw to the meaninglessness of the Civil War that rages on the mainland. If two people within a single tribe cannot make a peace, how is this poor world ever going to live?",674324,badelf,10.0,Positive

"**Surprisingly deep for a Stallone movie**Wonderful and uplifting movie and story with some relatively deep messages that I didn't expect in a superhero movie starring Stallone. The twist was good too and nicely build up, though maybe they were building up the twist a bit too well. Cause if you think about it, the title itself already gives away the twist, at least to someone who is familiar with the Bible and knows what ""Samaritan"" refers to.Cause a ""good Samaritan"" isn't simply a good guy, but is actually someone who is supposed to be bad, but turns out to become good in the end, which is exactly what Stallone's character (Joe) goes through. So in a way, he really is the Samaritan of the movie and the true antagonist Cyrus, really is the perfect ""nemesis"" for him as they are actually perfect counterparts. While Joe becomes good, Cyrus becomes bad. While Joe starts fighting crime, Cyrus instigates it. While Joe bears his cross, Cyrus breaks the cross (literally). Joe is a loner who avoids crowds and hates getting attention, while Cyrus baths in crowds, leads them and incites them, and while Joe goes around looking for broken things (both objects as well as people) that he can fix, Cyrus believes in ""Ordo ab Chao"" or to put it more direct, in breaking things before things can be rebuild.Talking on a deeper lever, there is both Christian and occult symbolism in this movie, though unlike with many other Hollywood movies, the occult aspects aren't glorified. And though the movie appears to be morally ambiguous, it actually isn't. Joe might seem like a very unchristian hero, but in the end he is probably the most Christian hero seen in a mainstream Hollywood movie in a long time.",629176,EmmanuelGoldstein,10.0,Positive
"“The Fabelmans” is a movie loosely based on the true story of Steven Spielberg’s own childhood. Produced after the death of his mother Leah Adler and using the fictional family name of the Fabelmans the movie focuses primarily on the iconic film makers family and the impact his parents divorce had on his young life.  “The Fabelmans” is rich in  exposing the influences behind classic movies like E.T. ( Set in a broken home ) and some early techniques at effects the film maker used to better his home movies. “The Fabelmans” starts in the 1950’s with Sammy Fabelman experiencing for the first time the magic of cinema with his parents. Slightly traumatised by the movie, particularly a train crash scene, it’s from this emotional experience the first glimpses of becoming a film maker appear. Who of us that have delved into the arts ( film making, actors , singers , performers , etc ) didn’t start off creating these types of home made replicas?  The idyllic family set up, with the ever growing confident and more adept young home movie maker,  becomes derailed when after editing his 8mm footage of a family camping trip he discovers all was not as he remembered.  The impact of what Sam discovers about his concert pianist mother and that fateful trip results in the eventual breakdown of his parents. As the movie moves into the early 1960’s and Spielberg’s high school years “The Fabelmans”touches on religion, race issues and first love. Due to the impact of that fateful camping holiday and therefore following a hiatus of not wanting to make any further home movies, Sam is persuaded by his girlfriend to film the end of school year beach party get together.  The impact of Sam’s return to film making is clearly visible after the graduation film he produced is shown at the school prom to great acclaim.  “The Fabelmans” is well documented as being a love letter to cinema but equally it is Spielberg’s love letter to his family. This is the movies key fact, the acceptance of multiple things happening all at once. Vocation is driven by both fear and talent, loving relationships break down, and movies that appear simplistic are highly sophisticated. With an extremely satisfying ending “ The Fabelmans” is a beautifully crafted work of art and remarkable insight into one of the most famous and influential directors Hollywood has ever produced",804095,tensharpe,8.0,Positive
"I liked it. It's good weekend movie or late night flick. It's not terribly deep but it has good special effects and good quality acting. The action scenes, when there needs to be action, are good. There is a good flow from scene to scene which staves off that dreaded ""grade B film"" feel. The comedy is good and not overly done or cheesy. I liked the sector chief, he was funny for being the grimey-boss. And Snoop Dogg was okay in the same laid back way he is. I still believe he fit the role of Jimmy Bones a lot better; though that movie was definitely for the $5 bin at Walmart. I believe Snoop would do very well as a Master Vamp or boss-guy-sitting-in-the chair type figure. As long as he doesn't have to emote. He does very well in line delivery which makes great comedy if you know how to write for him. All the actors did well in their roles. The villaness was good in her role, very arrogant & dispicable (nice on the eyes). The two vamp-killing brothers were both funny and performed great in their action scenes. And the speical effects, car chase scenes, and both the Home invasion and Nest scenes were top notch. The studio got their moneies worth when they hired the stuntman company. I do think they went a little hard with the ""wimpy"" sidekick thing. I didn't expect what happened to Franco's character to happen. I thought maybe he'd get his act togther when the circumstances got intense, but the writers took him in another direction that suprisingly (though not terribly original) made sense with the story. And I'm not sure WHY, but I keep getting Dave Franco and Zac Efron confused for one another...? (maybe it's the eyebrows) Franco has been in a number of teen movies and blockbusters...sorta kinda. I liked the _Fright Night_ re-make, _Neighbors 1 & 2_,(despite Seth Rogan being poison since the Santa Inc. debacle) and the _Now You See Me 1 & 2_ movies. He's not terrible. He did well for his character (and props to his stuntman) in this movie. As I said before, this is a good vampire movie. It's not exactly _Fright Night_, or _30 Days of Night_, but definitely holds its own. If I had to give it similarity by comparison, then I would say it leans more toward _Dusk til Dawn_, than anything else.Good Luck in your viewing! -- Bob --",755566,DallasBob,9.0,Positive

It's funny, the action scenes are very well done, the characters are charming, the dialogues are excellent and the animation style, in a mix of 2D and 3D, is the icing on the cake to complete an (almost) perfect animation.'Almost' because the plot was pretty average. It's interesting and even brings a nice message, but I think it lacked a little more development, especially in making the movie more unpredictable. Halfway through the movie you already knew who the villain was and how the movie was going to end. They even added multiple 'twists' to make the story more unpredictable, but almost all of them were far-fetched and failed to surprise me.Despite that, this movie was a breath of originality from Dreamworks after a decade of bland animations. I'll give it a solid 8.",629542,edu2703,8.0,Positive
"A social media and extremely influential power couple, Carl ( Harris Dickinson ) and Yaya ( Charlbi Dean Kriek ) are invited on board a private luxury super boat in a bid to promote the experience to their followers. The boat has a number of mega rich but morally bankrupt passengers and a large team of staff to pamper to their every whim. “Triangle of Sadness” develops characterisation as the audience get to know the guests, their status and their wealth. The Captain ( Woody Harrelson ) is fighting his own demons including alcohol to which he unfortunately succumbs during the Captains Meal. It is this particular evening, a rough night on the sea,  that events take a sinister turn with most passengers violently ill due to the effects of sea sickness. There are a number of graphic scenes of vomiting and over spilling toilets that leads to a blackout and the passengers and crew being thrown around by the rough weather.  As if the mega rich hadn’t suffered enough, further disaster unfolds that leads to a number of passengers and crew being stranded on a deserted island and fighting for survival. The questions “Triangle of Sadness” asks is, who is actually necessary to society and why? This harsh assault on capitalism takes a further turn when self proclaimed leader of the survivors , Abigail ( Dolly De Leon ) becomes poisoned by power and love or lust.

"It's a sad state of affairs when HALLOWEEN ENDS (2022) is being classed as a ""bad"", ""terrible"" or ""disgraceful"" motion picture and I worry for cinema as a whole if the only direction the mass want is nothing but cookie-cutter.This film is a straaaaaaange beast and it probably holds the world record for the quickest development of a relationship on screen.

"By January 2022, the book had sold 12 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time. Almost everyone in the theatre, yesterday afternoon, had read the book and were wondering if the movie could be as good as the book, so in my exit poll, of a dozen, or so, viewers, I asked then specifically, “Did the movie do justice to the book?” Without exception they said it had. (Although one reader thought the movie had a more definitive ending than the book.) Their ratings were 8s, 8.5s and two 10s. When I said that anything I rated over 8 would be worthy of a rewatch, it was unanimous that all of them would rewatch it, some thinking they’d like to read the book, again. So, these people, who came to see the movie, had high standards that they felt were met.The story is simple but intriguing. There is a whole TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD vibe to it. And there is a wonderful contrast between a purity of soul living within a world of threat and danger. It was refreshing to have a film celebrate innocence. The nature shots of North Carolina are breathtaking. The casting is spot on and the performances are flawless. But the success of the film lies with the lead actor, Daisy Edgar-Jones (a very talented Brit, who earned respect for her talents in another best selling novel adaptation for television, NORMAL PEOPLE). There is a wide eyed innocence about Kya that she captures which, in turn, captivates the audience to invest in her story and her plight. (The only disconnect I had with her portrayal was not her fault but that of the production. For a swamp girl, living off the grid, her personal hygiene and wardrobe were spotless and fitted to perfection. A seemingly unlikely possibility considering her environment.) I would definitely see this film again and am tempted to buy the audible book. I give this film an enthusiastic 9 (beautiful and touching) out of 10.

"WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a movie adaptation of the novel of the same name by Delia Owens. The movie is set in the early 1950s in the fictional town of Barkley Cove, North Carolina. Kya Clark (played by Daisy Edgar-Jones) is a young girl who lives in isolation after she is abandoned by her family. She becomes friends with Tate Walker (played by Taylor John Smith), a local boy who helps her learn how to read and write. When Tate also abandons her, Kya becomes involved with Chase Andrews (played by Harris Dickinson), the town's golden boy. When Chase is found dead, Kya becomes the prime suspect.The movie begins with the murder, unlike in the book. In the movie, Kya is arrested and put on trial at the start. The trial is the central focus of the movie, whereas in the book it is a secondary plotline. The movie does a decent job of adapting the book's complex plot and characters for the screen. However, it lacks the lyrical prose of the novel, which is one of the novel's greatest strengths.Daisy Edgar-Jones gives a breakout performance as Kya. She conveys Kya's isolation, desperation, and hope. The movie is worth watching for her performance alone. The movie is visually stunning, with sweeping shots of the North Carolina marshes. It's a beautiful backdrop for the story. In addition to her relationships with the two men in the story, a black couple also befriends Kya – Jumpin' (played by Sterling Macer Jr) and Mabel (played by Michael Hyatt). Their relationship is one of the most complex and interesting relationships in the movie.WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is not perfect. The film's pacing is uneven, and it struggles to find the right tone. The murder mystery plot is too convoluted and not particularly interesting. And the relationship between Kya and Chase feels forced and unconvincing. And there is no explanation of what a crawdad is! My understanding is that a crawdad is a freshwater crustacean that resembles a small lobster. They are also known as crayfish, crawfish, and crawdaddies. They live in the swamps battling for their existence – a metaphor for Kya's own battle to survive.The themes of love, loss, betrayal, and redemption are at the heart of this movie. Kya's story is a moving tale of human resilience in the face of great adversity. The ending is hopeful, though not without tragedy.Overall, WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING is a beautiful but flawed adaptation of a great novel. It's worth watching for the stunning visuals and Daisy Edgar-Jones' performance. But be prepared to be disappointed if you're expecting a faithful adaptation of the book.",682507,steveinadelaide l,7.0,Positive
"**_The challenges of growing up (alone) in the shoreline swamps of the Carolinas_**In the 60s, a girl (Daisy Edgar-Jones) comes-of-age in coastal North Carolina, where she’s an outcast known as “the marsh girl.” When a local hotshot is found dead (Harris Dickinson), the community thinks she’s the culprit. Taylor John Smith plays a male friend and David Strathairn her lawyer. Based on the 2018 novel by Delia Owens, “Where the Crawdads Sing” (2022) is a meshing of “Cross Creek” (1983) with backwoods crime mystery, such as ""Undertow"" (2004), ""Winter's Bone"" (2010) and ""Mud"" (2012).

"The original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre actually predated the original Halloween by four years, but now it’s the former’s turn to follow in the footsteps of the latter, resulting in a case of the blind leading the blind. This new Texas Chainsaw Massacre takes its cues from the recent Halloween and Halloween Kills, going as far as dusting off the franchise’s original Final Girl – the character, that is; Marilyn Burns, the actress who played the first Sally Hardesty, died in 2014, and she certainly is in a better place now (i.e., not in this movie).Generally speaking, though, the only thing that separates this from pretty much every slasher film ever made is that, instead of the usual Dead Teenager Movie, Massacre ‘22 may very well be the first-ever Dead Millennial Movie. Speaking of which the kills, which have the power to save even the most generic and derivative of horror sequels, are another disappointment; only the first one, involving a very creative use of the bone shard sticking out of a compound fracture, shows any ingenuity.The best thing that can be said of this uninspired effort is that it’s short (shorter still considering that about 10 of its 81 minutes are devoted to the closing credits); then again, any movie is bound to be brief that lacks a proper conclusion – and I’m not referring to the fact that when Sally, who has been hunting Leatherface down “for more than 30, 40 years”, finally has him cornered, she apparently decides, all of a sudden, that after having waited multiple decades for this moment, she might as well wait a bit longer; after all, what’s another five more minutes between old friends? This is excruciatingly stupid, but if the movie ended there it wouldn't be any more unsatisfying than the actual ending.And the worst that can be said of TCM ‘22 is that it has the gall to draw a parallel between the titular chainsaw massacre and a high school shooting (“Stonebrook High”, which sounds very uncomfortably like Stoneman Douglas High School), as if a dumb movie that deals in gratuitous violence and doesn’t even have the decency to provide a cathartic resolution could ever find a way to connect emotionally to the victims of a real-life massacre. This is low, even by exploitation cinema’s sub-standards.",632727,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative
"The reluctant ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" franchise gets yet another reboot/reimagining/sequel, but this time they go the Halloween/Kills/Ends route and bring back a surviving character from the original film. Things don't work out as well here as they did for the ""Halloween"" series.Four idealistic, or naive?, friends purchase a ghost town in Texas. They plan on renovating the entire town, and turning it into a progressive haven where they can save the world. Sisters Melody (Sarah Yarkin) and Lila (Elsie Fisher), and couple Dante (Jacob Latimore) and Ruth (Nell Hudson) have run-ins with local law enforcement and some town hangers-on, with the film makers casting aspersions immediately- the Gen Z/millenials are portrayed as wide-eyed and woke, while the Texans encountered are a bunch of drawling, gun-toting racists. Lila was injured in a school shooting, and Melody hovers over her constantly. The group hear the tale of Leatherface from the 1974 original film, and we learn that the final surviving girl from that film, Sally (Olwen Fouere, taking the role originated by the late Marilyn Burns), became a Texas Ranger and is currently waiting for the call that her archnemesis may still be found since the murders of her friends are officially listed as ""unsolved."" The group arrives in the ghost town to wait for a busload of investors, and find that an old lady (Alice Krige) and her adopted son (Mark Burnham) are still living in an abandoned orphanage. The ghost town is going to get renovated by one man, Richter (Moe Dunford), who doesn't take to the group. Leatherface finally makes a questionable appearance, there's a lot of questions throughout, and the carnage begins.The timeline for the TCM franchise is even more convoluted than the Halloween franchise. The film is barely over eighty minutes long, so there isn't a lot of character development or legacy building, although I did see director Garcia paying tribute to some other famous slasher films here and there. The script tries to inject something different into its story, addressing the influencer craze without going overboard with it. Garcia's direction works with well with the film's editing, and this is a tightly shot flick, although Bulgaria makes a lousy substitute for the Lone Star state- I'm a fourth generation born Texan, and know my birth state pretty well.The problem here is, of course, the script. Characters not only make bad decisions, they make idiotic decisions that literally get themselves and others killed. While some of them evolve and put up a fight against Leatherface, they also open themselves up to their own demise because if they didn't, the movie would be even shorter. The gore and violence is over the top, and I was very surprised that it got an (R) rating. The special effects are very well done, but also very convincing, to the point that this isn't a ""fun"" horror film. ""Terrifier"" was also a gory slasher/horror film, but it had tension and suspense. ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" has little tension, and viewers asking aloud ""why did they just do that?!"" instead. One set-piece on a bus was probably set up as the be-all end-all of gruesome mass murder, but it becomes a nihilistic exercise in tedium. In this day and age, it's sad that we've become so numb, this is considered entertainment to be ""enjoyed"" again and again, considering that the original film, aside from one of the greatest titles of all-time, wasn't as gory as you would expect.I think it's okay to finally put this franchise to rest, it debuted on streaming because of some disastrous pre-release screenings so don't look for it on physical media anytime soon. I didn't hate it as much as some viewers and critics did; I guess I'm old school, looking for the horror in my horror films.",632727,CharlesTatum,2.0,Negative
"I think the key to figuring out this movie is an early scene in which one of the characters is wearing a Jurassic Park shirt. This must be the filmmakers winking their eye at the audience, letting us know that what we’re about to see is all in jest. How else to explain a film where the protagonists arrive in South Africa and immediately start bitching about the heat, but they’re all wearing jackets, and sweaters, and hoodies? More importantly, how are we to interpret a movie that introduces the issues of poaching (people who kill lions) and anti-poaching (people who kill people who kill lions, or at least that’s what Beast thinks it is), only to have the antagonist be a maneater (a lion that kills people regardless of their stance on poaching).This only perpetuates the myth that lions have never met a human they didn’t want to maul (while contributing nothing to the poaching debate). I’m not saying lions follow an animal version of the First Law of Robotics, but they do get a bad rap in the movies, as do sharks — and in that sense, Beast is closer to Jaws: The Revenge than Jaws. Actually, Beast is even worse than Jaws: The Revenge because the latter at least used a mechanical shark, as opposed to the former’s pitiful CGI lion. All things considered, this is a film that makes you yearn for the simplicity of The Ghost and the Darkness, which made no pretense of being anything other than a Hemingway-lite story about male bonding over hunting big game (and which, though taking many liberties with the source material, had the decency to feature real lions). Here, however, the hero tricks two other lions into killing the 'evil' lion, not only a gambit that could easily backfire, but also not very nature-friendly. Although coming to think about it, maybe these lions do comply with the second part of the First Law (""A robot [or in this case, lion] may not ... through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm"").",760741,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative

One poorly contrived scene after another, belief is not just suspended, but abandoned entirely to piece together a cartoonish presentation of sappy ideas and bad cgi.

"In the middle of 2022, the movie I was looking forward to the most was '**Blonde**', but... I'm really disappointed.The film has nowhere to hold on, it's just a fictional compilation of the supposed life of **Marilyn Monroe**, where we don't get context and it's easy to get lost through the scenes and the large number of characters (_which if you didn't know the story, you wouldn't really know who they are_) of a feature film of almost three hours. The direction is good, although quite experimental where sometimes elements that seem to come out of nowhere are combined. Not to mention the constant switching between color and black/white that doesn't seem to represent anything concrete.**Ana de Armas's** performance is brilliant, by far the best of the film, despite how poor her character is.I'm really disappointed, in these times we live in, designing a movie about **Marilyn Monroe** could have contained a much more powerful message. The story of a woman who went through the sexualization of the industry in the 50's. Instead the film only seems to add fuel to the fire by showing nudity at any time and sometimes for no reason.Based on a story in parts fictitious, with a vision, in my opinion, poorly focused, they make 'Blonde' a great disappointment.",301502,JulesAndVincent6,4.0,Negative

"Jealousy is such a living hell that Claude Chabrol made arguably the definitive film on the subject and literally called it L’Enfer. This is an area of human relations with which Deep Water director Adrian Lyne is very comfortable, having previously directed Fatal Attraction, Indecent Proposal, Lolita (which I find superior to Kubrick’s version), and Unfaithful (loosely based on Chabrol's La Femme Infidèle. Coincidence?). To call this a retread is somewhat of an understatement, but Lyne is wise to have chosen familiar territory for his return from a 20-year break from directing.Deep Water is likewise a good career move for Ben Affleck; it gets him back on track after he followed the great The Way Back with The Last Duel and The Tender Bar (although Deep Water would have preceded all those films had it not been for covid-related delays; funny how things work). Here is a movie that allows him to give a subtly nuanced performance, and he doesn’t disappoint, taking passive-aggressiveness and elevating it into an art form.Affleck now joins his BFF Matt Damon as actors who have shined in roles based on characters created by Patricia Highsmith (and indeed this is how one might imagine Tom Ripley’s married life to be). Ana de Armas is also quite good as Melinda, Vic’s (Affleck) wife, a thoroughly despicable bitch on wheels whose only redeeming quality is Vic’s unconditional love for her.Oh, he loves her with almost all his heart. I say ‘almost’ because his heart may or may not be able to pump enough blood to a certain other organ – thus it is tacitly agreed that Melinda has the freedom to find solace elsewhere, usually in the arms of intellectually challenged younger men. This arrangement is no secret among the couple’s friends because Melinda is also an alcoholic with zero self-awareness.Vic dismisses the whole thing in public with a blend of dry wit, deadpan sarcasm, and self-deprecating humor (which provides some of the best dialogue in the film) that can turn ambiguously menacing at the drop of hat, especially when he finds himself alone with one of Melinda’s boytoys.In addition to Chabrol, Lyne puts me in mind of iconoclastic British filmmaker Peter Greenaway – and not just because Vic’s pet snails remind me of A Zed & Two Noughts. I generally find movies where characters literally get away with murder in one way or another to be immoral; the few exceptions to this rule include films like Greenaway's in which there is no conventional morality to speak of in the first place. In Deep Water, no major, plot-relevant character is innocent, and they all get what they deserve – even when, like Vic, they get what they want.",619979,tmdb28039023,7.0,Positive
"A rare squalor turned out, of course. The characters are like pictures of a bad artist, flat and empty. Facial expressions and forms are alien. There is no aesthetic admiration for this attempt at expression in 3d. No grace and beauty. There is no depth and love, an adequate plot. Inappropriate flat humor. A fierce mockery of the innermost. A ridiculous untalented division without a sense of beauty, reminiscent of the very pirated products from the movie. They piled everything up and made an unintelligible dump. A bunch of some defective characters, like that Sonic who talks about the existence of the original Sonic, by the way... They ridiculed the key points, just for fun, quite unreasonably, only comedy is completely out of place here, as are the creators-comedians. And all this, of course, under the sauce ""We love Rescuers"". Well, well... We couldn't do it, in general, for real. In a Disney way. Only that picture was remembered, which hung on the wall of the actor Roquefort. And how wonderful it would be if the whole movie was of this style and with an adequate plot.Fortunately, this is not an original reality that could continue the canon. To understand this substitution, which tried to continue the series, it is enough to see in the film an episode with the participation of Akiva Shaffer, who allegedly filmed the original series in 1990, damn it. That's the only thing I thank him for.",420821,Jordan_Gadger,2.0,Negative
"Taught me that Indian movies apparently should just be ignored, as ratings apparently tell you absolutely nothing about the quality of a film.This is perhaps the worst acting I've ever seen - Plan 9 from Outer Space included - with post-production dubbed voices to boot! Add to that the most cringey, cartoonish pathetic storyline, and you're seriously wondering if this is all a joke. No, SERIOUSLY wondering.I considered I might keep watching for the laughs (I was laughing from the very first scene with the lip surgery receiving evil white woman sitting in the jungle in the 1920s surrounded by kneeling indigenous worshippers and a terribly-dubbed studio recording of a little girl singing, with the girl not even remote knowing the lyrics and making all the wrong mouth movements to pretend it's actually her doing the singing). But then I realized at 3h5m, the cringey OMG-it's-so-bad-it's-funny laughs definitely wouldn't last that long.Holy graboid on a blind horse, Batman, this is so bad!No more Indian movies for me.

"The Cinemark near me has started to show Indian movies. Not feeling like sitting home tonight, I decided to catch this one, and luck was with me.My image of Indian movies, I confess, was that they were mostly musicals centering around a love story involving a very beautiful young woman and a very handsome young man, with lots of elaborate, high-energy dance numbers to keep things going.There is a love story here, but it's not the focus of the film. There are also a few large and very impressive dance numbers, but only a few. (The men's dancing, extremely athletic, astounded me.)Rather, this movie focuses on the story of two young men in 1920s India who, each in his own way, are fighting against the English occupiers.The English are portrayed as inhuman monsters. Very often, they made me think of the worst atrocities committed by the Germans in France during World War II, or the most rabid racists in the American South. The first time we see the two male leads dancing, a link is indeed made between the Indians and what appear to be Black American musicians.Every time the Indians manage to take revenge on the English for their inhuman abuse of the Indians, you cheer - but at times I wondered if I would have cheered watching a parallel movie about Blacks taking revenge on white racists who had mistreated them in the American South, especially if I had been in a movie theater where, like tonight, I was the only audience member who did not belong to the oppressed population. Imagine Spike Lee, for example, able to make a movie in which he did not have to worry about selling tickets to whites as well as Blacks, and you have some idea of how anti-British colonials this movie is. It is the difference between a society in which the oppressor was a small minority of the population vs. Here, where Blacks are a minority of the American population. I don't want to push this comparison too far. The movie only makes the connection in one scene. But this is very definitely a movie that focuses on the story of a brutally oppressed people seeking freedom from an inhuman oppressor, rather than just a series of dance numbers.I don't speak any of the Indian languages used in the movie, but I had no problem following what was going on with the subtitles, which were almost always easy to read. I'm sure there were cultural references I didn't catch, however, especially at the end in the final big dance number, which seemed to be presenting India as a nation of different regions and cultures all united in one.The director and cinematographer definitely deserve praise. There was one very striking visual image after the next, especially during the battle scenes. Ram Charan, dressed as a ""native warrior""-if that term means anything anymore-flying through flames was breathtaking.So, if you've even been curious about Indian movies, give this one a try. Yes, it's three hours long, but trust me, the time goes flying by. This is truly an action movie, a mixture of visual fantasy and often very graphic realism that held my interest to the end.",579974,kamaravichow,10.0,Positive
"This movie is one, really fun, action-packed, superhero watch. The CGI, of course, is fantastic. What I love about this movie, though, is that it's not just an empty, trivial story as an excuse for CGI. Quite the contrary. The story itself is a fictionalized version of a very real, revolutionary period just before Gandhi's non-violence movement took the lead.If anyone could make any complaint at all, it would be that the British roles are caricatures. Honestly though, what do we white Americans know of how Imperial Britain treated its ""non-white subjects""? We DO know that, in 1919, British troops fired on a crowd of unarmed protesters killing hundreds of men, women and children. So the film is steeped in real history. Perhaps, the caricatures were Rajamouli's way of side-stepping the issue by allowing the viewer to accept them at the same level of unreality as the two super heroes of the film.The film itself is over the top, fun and action-packed. It even has the requisite Bollywood dance scenes! I loved the way Ram became Rama, the mythological Hindu archer, an avatar of Vishnu. I probably missed other cultural references, but I suspect that when the two superheroes cooperate, they have 4 arms - that is Shiva, the destroyer with a bow and arrow in two of the arms. The story and production design are gripping. S.S. Rajamouli does such an amazing job with the pacing that three hours seems to fly by before you can even say popcorn.",579974,badelf,10.0,Positive

"Owen Wilson better be careful lest he becomes the go-to for aging Latino MILFs. Last year he managed to save Bliss from Salma Hayek’s strident overacting, but he has no such luck with Jennifer Lopez in Marry Me. Now, to be fair, the movie’s failure is not her fault, and she acquits herself a lot better than Hayek did; it also helps that Lopez is essentially playing herself – a mega popstar with a string of failed marriages. And whereas she isn’t an acting prodigy, nor is, for that matter, Maluma, who plays her temporary fiancee, they are nevertheless performers who know their way around a stage and are extremely comfortable in front of an audience.It’s no surprise then that the only genuine moments in Marry Me take place during a sold-out show – that is, of course, until Kat Valdez (Lopez), having discovered, right before they are supposed to tie the knot in between musical numbers that Bastian (Maluma) has been unfaithful, has what can only be termed as a psychotic break and decides to pick out a random dude from the audience and marry him on the spot instead. Let’s put it like this: this plot is too outlandish even for Wilson, and he has been in several Wes Anderson films.The reason that Charlie (Wilson) is at the concert is pretty random itself; Parker (Sarah Silverman), her friend and colleague – they are both teachers, or at least he is a math teacher that, as it often occurs in the movies, has only a handful of students in his charge; she on the other hand mostly appears to just hang around the school –, planned to attend the show with her girlfriend, but her girlfriend broke up with her, so she asks Charlie to come and bring her daughter along. Ok, so this is the hottest show in town – sold out, as I mentioned above –, but Parker just happens to conveniently have a third ticket available; still harder to believe is that her girlfriend didn't wait until after the concert to break up with her.Anyway, that very same night Kat is already the butt of Jimmy Fallon’s jokes on The Tonight Show – which is obviously impossible because The Tonight Show doesn’t air live; in fact, it is taped in the afternoon and broadcast hours later. But who knows? Maybe Jimmy is clairvoyant and, having seen the whole thing coming, pre-taped a few pertinent jokes. All things considered, you know you’re in big trouble when your movie makes less overall sense than Notting Hill.",615904,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative

"**A very good comedy and generally palatable to almost everyone.**I just finished watching this movie with a friend of mine, and we were both pleased with what we saw. The film is an excellent comedy that manages to reach two different audiences: today's youth and their parents, who were young twenty years ago, because it makes direct allusions to various cultural elements that were very familiar to them. Personally, I was still very young in 2002, I was about to enter adolescence, but I was also touched by some nostalgic aspects.The script is reasonably simple, but it works well: it all starts with Stephanie, and the way she decides to become popular and accepted after being snubbed at school. Things go well, and she becomes the archetype of the perfect teenager: sexy, blonde, cheerleader, sexually expedite, with an enviable boyfriend and a promising future. The icing on the cake was going to be her election as High School Prom Queen, and a massive after-party, complete with loss of virginity. It didn't happen: in an elaborate dance choreography, and by the work of a rival, she falls and ends up hospitalized, in a coma, for twenty years. In 2022, at last, she wakes up to a horrible reality: her body has changed, life has passed, her boyfriend married her rival, she is not the same and has nothing of what she wanted. So, she decides to go back to the High School, finish what she started and be Prom Queen… but the School has abolished that!The script seeks to include a series of cultural allusions to the 90s and 2000s, ranging from films and series (_Sex and the City_, _Deep Impact_, _Aly McBeal_, _Clueless_), songs and musical artists (Britney Spears, Madonna, Mandy Moore) and objects of fashion and mass culture (the Tamagotchi, for example). We, who saw ourselves as teenagers between 2000 and 2010, know these things well, they were our fads and fashions. The film also criticizes the way today's youth view social and environmental causes, virtual life and social networks. In fact, it is easy to lose sight of reality when we have Instagram and Facebook full of thousands of friends and followers, and the film criticizes the young people who spend most of their time on these networks and the “influencers” who earn a lot of money at the expense of them, in addition to making jokes about the insincere way in which many young people face environmental and ecological causes, which they follow out for fashion and not because they are really aware of their importance. The film is very inclusive, and there are several characters that are of diverse ethnicities or homosexuals, explicitly or implicitly. This is something that Hollywood have been insisting on a lot after the Me Too movement and the Oscar boycott by black actors a few years ago, and I understand, although I don't like to see films used for political and social activism.The cast has a powerful Rebel Williams in the lead role. She is not a rookie actress and has already shown us what she can do in other comedies like _Hustle_ or in dance movies like _Pitch Perfect_, and I daresay she is one of the most promising faces of Australian comedy this year. time. The film also features excellent guest appearances by Justin Hartley, Sam Richardson, Zoe Chao, Mary Holland and Chris Parnell. They each did their work very hard, and Chao, Richardson and Holland deserve special praise. As for the younger cast, I would highlight the good performance of Angourie Rice and also Jade Bender. The film also has a cameo by Alicia Silverstone, who has made similar films in her past, as we all know.Technically, the film appears to be very low-key, overall. The cinematography is regular, there are no major visual gimmicks and the camera opts for a conventional shooting style. Filmed in Georgia but set in Maryland, the film chose its filming locations well and builds many of its sets over green screen, in high-quality, expensive CGI animation. The soundtrack makes good use of popular pop songs, in recognizable voices, and there are some very good dance routines where Williams shines.",800937,FilipeManuelNeto,9.0,Positive

"At the risk of sounding like a purist, Jackass Forever is one comeback too many. I’m aware that expecting purity from this franchise is akin to drawing blood from the proverbial stone, but even when taken on its own terms, it’s safe to say that there is no Jackass without Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn – just like there wouldn’t be any Jackass sans Johnny Knoxville or Steve-O. To its credit, JF doesn’t try to replace the irreplaceable, but it does attempt to fix what’s not broken by injecting ‘new blood’ into the cast (come to think of it, it's definitely broken, and it doesn't get fixed either).Thus, we get a new fat guy, even though the old fat guy is still around (and still round). Why? You already have a fat dude; you don’t need two fat dudes. Similarly, with the likes of Dave England, known for his ability – if one can call it that – to defecate on cue, what need is there for a Dave England-lookalike named Poopies? All of this makes as much sense as having another little person on set other than Wee Man – and again, I know that ‘sense’ doesn’t enter the equation here, but just because the performers are dumb enough to do what they do to themselves, it doesn’t mean that the fan base, among whose numbers I count myself, is too dumb to have its intelligence insulted.There is no point in introducing newcomers this late in the game, especially considering that, as JF makes abundantly clear, watching random strangers suffering grievous bodily harm isn’t all that funny; ironically, it’s much funnier when it happens to people you have come to know and actually like over the years – and even then the novelty has doubtless finally worn off (and it certainly had a damn good run); there is a lot more deja vu in the proceedings than there is nostalgia. All things considered, I was considerably more entertained by Knoxville’s match with Sami Zayn at Wrestlemania 38 than by Jackass Forever.",656663,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative
"The premise, as an elevator pitch, might have worked.With some research, a good script, and some solid acting and direction, this might have been a good, entertaining action flick. But it isn't.No-one bothered to do a tiny bit of research to make the scenario, the tech, the military babble or insignias at least somewhat OK-ish. The CGI is a the level YT kids do these days, and the story is threadbare recycled fare. Plus, as some complained, too much ""woke BS"" - I intended to go along with some plot elements at first, but it's so coarsely piled on, it becomes unbearable. And don't get me started on the ""acting"".As audience, we are making a deal with the moviemakers. We provide some suspension of disbelief, accept some bits that aren't realistic, and they put in some effort to accommodate us in this regard. Unless they are lazy as in this case. Then it becomes insulting how little they think of us.Action stars don't need to have real acting chops; if they do, it is a very welcome addition, and can mean actual stardom. But the least we can expect is Expendables-level effort.There is still a niche for old-fashioned save-the-world-action flicks, I'm sure of that.

"While “Emily the Criminal” isn't for everyone, it does succeed on many fronts. It's not your run-of-the-mill crime flick; instead, it's an in-depth look at the mind of its main character and examination of criminal behaviour. The film's overall noir vibe appeals to me, and I think its effectiveness as a small-scale thriller stems from its commitment to staying grounded, scaled down, and focused. Additionally commendable is Plaza's performance, and given that this is John Patton Ford's directorial debut, he, too, is deserving of recognition for his efforts. Yet, despite its entertaining nature, the film fails to make a lasting impression.___**Rating**: 7.0/10 _(Good)_",862965,AhmadZQ,7.0,Positive
"It’s a bright looking setting for such a dark time in history in Munich: The Edge of war - Everything looks colourful and stylish. Nevertheless Schwochow keeps the tension up right from the beginning. It’s a classic case of the audience knowing more than the characters. Helping with the tension is keeping the Germans speaking German. The film has an impending doom about it. It's Titanic meets a world war with lots of people being wrong in their assurances of the future. This is fine, they're saying. The tension between the two leads Legat and von Hartmann reflects the tensions between the countries yet somehow in reverse. They are trying to reconcile while their countries irrevocably turn to war. The script is good enough not just to make these two characters overly simple.McKay finds himself again being a messenger right back in the wars (after after he starred in 1917) with the world being on the verge of WWII. He just must be made of the right stuff - or at least the running stuff.Irons thrives as the miscalculating Chamberlain PM, while the film shows him to be harshly treated by history. Everyone seems anxious as if there was a war on or something.The theme of personal need versus national duty comes up as well as the sacrifices required come in opposite directions when some are sacrificing for the country and others are against it. The film serves as inspiration and a warning for future skirmishes. Viewers can be glad the filmmakers resisted the temptation of calling this Hitler’s Translator.

"Full Analysis at Spotamovie.com **- Intro -** The lovers of negotiations, conspirators and historical dramas will enjoy the movie. The story focuses on the 1938 Munich Agreement. However, the director embraces the fictional way more than the historical one, and the film becomes an enjoyable drama enriched with some taste of a thriller. **- The Story -** In autumn 1938, Europe was on the brink of war. Hitler claimed back the territory of Sudetenland, belonging at that moment to Czechoslovakia. If Hitler invades the Czech, France and Britain must protect them. Prime Minister Chamberlain and his staff have less than 24 hours to find a diplomatic solution and prevent a tragic European conflict. Behind the lines, two old friends, Hugh Legat and Paul von Hartmann weave the web to keep the peace and change the course of history. The solution seems to be a quick agreement to give back to the Germans the Sudetenland. But will it be enough? Who are Hugh and Paul?

"I don't rate a film 10/10 unless it's wonderful and my reviews tend to be motivated by either abject disappointment or outright admiration. I think that's very much most people's experience of film, you either love it or you don't.With Close, there's everything to love and it is an exercise in pure love, not just in its storyline but also the art of film, acting and storytelling. Importantly. It is akin to a dissection, an expert analysis of youth told through the eyes of two boys in tremendous pain. It is nuanced and a near savant, perceptive commentary on the predjudices cultivated within the human predicament from the very outset. It captures perfectly how instilled bigotry dessicates pure innocence from the moment a child sets foot into wider society via the educational system and it is a damning indictment of what we've become or failed to become, more accurately.The storyline shows how deep rooted prejudice can destroy a pure and innocent love between two boys, and it perfectly contrasts how the insipid and evil innuendo from female quarters feeds into to the outright violent machismo in male quarters, together combining to destroy the boys' idea of what their friendship was, to sully it unjustly and to make them feel that what was wonderful is wrong, to make them paranoid and defensive. It is a tale as old as time, the despicable and mean way jealous observers seek to destroy what they can't have, because they don't have that capacity. And it is infuriating as a viewer to see homophobia cast onto an innocent friendship at a tender age because it is precursive homophobia targeted at closeness, at innocent brotherly love. It is infuriating because it shows how deep rooted homophobia is in both girls' and boys' upbringing - bigotry that is used to target close friendship and innocence as a near precautionary measure, vaccinating the world at large against any male affection just in case it might turn into something more.There is much praise for this film and the writer/director Lukas Dhont is talented beyond what many critics seem to be able to bring themselves to admit, for he has, at a rather youthful age, created a work which leaves many in the industry probably wondering how he does it and where they went wrong.If Hollywood is the centre of the movie business, it is only due to money, and Lukas Dhont has, in this Belgian film, and as much French cinema has done before, shone a light on what cinema can and should be, and by comparison, he puts the typical offerings of Hollywood to shame. It is truly a comparison of fast food to haute cuisine.By way of another comparison and a similar study of loss, there was much praise for Aftersun and I gave it a great review. Having now seen Close, I think Aftersun is rudimentary in comparison and I wonder if the fact that Close is in French/Flemish is sufficient enough a reason for it to languish behind in terms of accolades and praise when compared to Aftersun, which, while deserving of much praise, is nothing of equal merit whatsoever - not even Close.For anyone wanting to learn about cinema and storytelling on screen, about acting and direction, Close is the objective to aim for, a masterclass in perfection. It will break your heart.",901563,PlutoZoo,10.0,Positive
"The takeaway from Against the Ice is that not all CGI is bad — which doesn’t necessarily mean that some of it is good, only that some examples are comparatively worse than others. There is a scene in this movie that will remind you of The Revenant, except that the bear in Alejandro González Iñárritu’s film is one of its most memorable aspects; as for the one in Against the Ice, let’s just say that I’ve seen more realistic polar bears in those Coca-Cola Christmas ads. Now, both scenes involve lots of computer generated imagery and a stuntman pretending to be a carnivorous mammal of the Ursidae family, so the difference between awesome and pathetic lies in the performance of the actor being attacked.Like in pro wrestling, the encounter between Leo DiCaprio and the bear may not have been spontaneous, and its outcome may have been predetermined, but that doesn’t mean the actor didn’t take an actual beating, getting thrown around to and fro like a ragdoll by way of wires; moreover, all of his facial and body language is committed to selling the gravity of the situation, which in turn makes the bear, CGI or not, look like a million bucks. Meanwhile in Against the Ice, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau pretty much just lies there, bringing no urgency to what should be a life-and-death struggle.This scene is symptomatic of Against the Ice, which is no less a collection of clichés than The Revenant, but whereas the latter amounts to much more than the sum of its parts thanks to superb execution, the former is too conventional to ever transcend its chosen genre. Consider the way it tracks the passage of time beginning with “Day 1”, which is of course a logical starting point, but also a very obvious one; from there it skips all the way to “Day 26” — my question is, since apparently nothing of note happened in the first 25 days, why not just start with the 26th day and go from there? All things considered, no one will be surprised to learn that Ejnar Mikkelsen (Coster-Waldau) — on whose book (or, presumably, a translation of the same, seeing as how the Danish characters all speak English as a first language) the movie is based — and Iver Iverson (Joe Cole) “remained friends for life”, but don’t they always? Just like Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush in the King’s Speech, or Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali in Green Book. All movies “based on a true story” take extreme liberties with their source material, and I usually hate it when they do, but Against the Ice would have been considerably less trite if the makers had gone the opposite route with the characters’ relationship; after all, in the words of Mr. Burns following a similar but by no means as protracted ordeal, “once you've been through something like that with a person, you never want to see that person again.”",836009,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative
"**Classic horror formula brought back to haunt our modern times**I do feel this movie has a potential to one day become a classic of it's own. A good horror movie takes the things that plague the everyday lives of it's contemporary audience and exposes their dark side, but without spelling things out. Resulting in the audience feeling very uneasy, but not knowing exactly why. All classic horror movies pull that off and this one does an equally good job targeting a modern audience with modern issues.Like with all horror movies that apply this formula (and all the good ones ALWAYS do) this movie therefore relies on building things up in the first act and having the audience relate to the characters and their relatable everyday issues and interpersonal conflicts. Which might seem dull (especially for today's audience with its notoriously short attention span) but it's an absolutely crucial and necessary build up for the 3rd act in which the *bleep* will finally hit the fan.So while the everyday problems of an average modern family might seem boring to sit through and might seem like they have nothing to do with the scary monster that will figuratively and/or literally, but inevitably show up at the end, it in reality has EVERYTHING to do with it and actually any monster is merely the personification of the dark aspects of the issues that are addressed in the first act.Also, like so many horror movies nowadays, this movie includes some references to the occult. But unlike in many other horror movies, these occult aspects are not in any way glorified, yet are portrayed fairly accurately, though of course taken with a slight artistic license. Which I think is what you would want. I mean after all and assuming black magic is real, you wouldn't want your audience accidentally summoning the dark forces after casually reciting some dialogue from the latest haunted house movie :-)",758724,EmmanuelGoldstein,10.0,Positive
"A thought provoking and moving, truly remarkable film. Could have been made with such dryness but Sarah Polley's inventive direction and incredible script combine wonderfully. Wisely chooses to be both gutting and uplifting. The discussions brought up are fascinating and not a single line of dialogue is wasted. All delivered by an outstanding cast, with Jessie Buckley being the best in show in a nuanced and fierce performance. One of the best of the year.",777245,kidsocarides1,10.0,Positive
"First of all, let me say that I don't rate movies based on happy ending or bad ending. I rate them by their impact. If movie had an impact on you, if it affected you, this means movie was strong and achieved its goal, doesn't matter if it's a positive or negative impact. And Based on my criteria, this movie is 10/10! This movie actually traumatized me. I have seen a lot of horror movies, but this one affected me a lot, because unlike those paranormal movies about demons, devil and etc, this one is realistic, which means this what happened in this movie, might be happening in real somewhere. And when we - viewers watch movies, we feel for main characters and what I felt for them in this movie was very big pain. It left me very angry and whole night I had last scenes in my mind when I was lying in bed, because I was imagining what if I was in their place... I won't give you a spoiler, but be warned, if you're sensitive person and if you decide to watch it, it will traumatize you. It's a masterpiece, but with a very sad and bad ending.",833339,Ditendra,10.0,Positive

"I’m sorry to report that Alyssa Milano does not forego her long-standing ‘no nudity clause’ in Brazen — and I’m more sorry for her than for me (after all, I’ve seen Embrace of the Vampire), because that’s about the only thing that could save this mess. Milano is Grace Miller, authoress of thriller novels. Here is an excerpt from her most recent masterpiece, titled Brazen Virtue:""She did not expect to die that night. Sara Bowman was precise in everything, and dying was not on her agenda. She had no enemies that she knew of. In general, his life was quite ordinary. Yet there she was, lying in a pool of her own blood. The manner of her death violent, even deranged. Who would want to kill the ordinary Sara Bowman? And then it dawned on her. What if she wasn’t ordinary? What if she had a secret life?""It would have to be a very secret secret life indeed if not even “Sarah” herself was aware of it. It turns out that Brazen is based on a novel also called Brazen Virtue by Nora Roberts; I’m not familiar with her work, but I wouldn’t be surprised if her books opened with the phrase “It was a dark and stormy night” or some variation thereof.In addition to a purveyor of purple prose, Grace is a dispenser of clumsy exposition, like when she tells her sister Kathleen (Emilie Ullerup) that “Last I heard you were addicted to pills and you abandoned your son.” Something tells me this is not news to Kathleen, who is an English teacher at an upper-class boys’ high school: “Next week’s essay will be on Hamlet. How would Hamlet feel in our digital age?I’m pretty sure Ethan Hawke already answered this question, and the answer wasn’t very compelling (besides, a better question would be how would Romeo feel in the digital age, considering that a simple SMS would have saved him a lot of trouble).Would you believe that Kathleen herself just happens to have a double life of her own? Well, she does; her alter ego is Desiree, a web cam dominatrix. Wait, what? I guess all her customers must be naughty little boys, because for a fetish based on discipline, this is incredibly lazy.Anyway, Kathleen soon gets sent to web cam heaven, and Grace hijacks her sister’s homicide investigation, which is nominally led by Detective Ed Jennings (Sam Page) — who conveniently lives next-door to Kathleen — and his partner, Detective Ben Parker (Malachi Weier), who may be named after Spiderman’s uncle, but he looks like the lead singer in a Melvins cover band.Grace talks Ed and Ben’s boss, Captain Rivera (Alison Araya) into appointing her a “consultant” on the case (someone’s been watching too much Lucifer). Grace justifies this claiming that “I have an instinct for motive. I mean, that’s why my books are so successful. I can enter the mind of a murderer, especially those who attack women.”Ed, who is present and opposes the idea, fails to point out that Grace would be a pretty lousy writer (well, lousier) if she couldn’t freely enter the mind of a killer that she made up in the first place.Unchecked, Grace adds, “Do you know how long it took the NYPD to find the Times Square Rapist? Eight months. And I went in, studied the case, and they caught the guy three days later.” Again, it doesn’t cross Ed’s mind to call this a coincidence or suggest that the guy was caught thanks to those eight months of police work, and not Grace’s three days.The Captain, who must have found her badge in a cereal box, is sold, however; “Grace, I read your books from cover to cover as soon as I can get my hands on them. You truly are one of the most cunning profilers out there.” Thankfully, the scene ends before the brownosing becomes literal.What I don’t understand is why director Monika Mitchell — and that a woman directed this, as it were, brazen display of pseudo-feminism is most baffling — goes to such lengths to promote Grace as a prodigious detective mind when she never even comes close to determining the killer’s identity or motive (despite having “lots of ideas” about it), or why screenwriters Edithe Swensen and Donald Martin force Milano to say, with all the sincerity she can muster, that Grace’s novels are “about the exploitation of women and misogyny and patriarchy and how we do very little to protect the most vulnerable”, only to have her catch the villain by literally using her body as bait. It may contain no full-frontal nudity, but Brazen is nonetheless one of the most embarrassing movies Milano has ever been in (for what it’s worth, she’s a stone-cold MILF, though).",916740,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative

"Not exactly my cup of tea, but still fantastic. Needless to say, this was an interesting film, and it's nice to get away from Hollywood for a change. Though it wasn't particularly a 'must-rewatch'. And there was a sequence or two that may have been a bit predictable, and maybe a few things here and there. But there were definitely quite a ton of aspects I really liked and honestly just wasn't expecting.The thing that stood out the most was the way they utilized a single location and a relatively small cast. They way they did so much with so little makes it feel a lot more like a folk film or indie film. The idea of the entire story surrounding just one location would seem boring, lackluster and just interesting. But luckily, this isn't the case. There are some pretty high stakes when it comes to the vulnerable kids, and the scenes of Jessica's fight against Sammy (no spoilers) especially caught me off guard, and really kept the anxiety and tension high.So at the end of the day, the Daily Wire did a fantastic job of giving us a Hollywood-quality thriller film that focuses on telling a good and unique story instead of pushing ""the message"". 7.5/10.",629015,BryceSpencer,7.0,Positive

"I recently saw a trailer for the South Korean horror movie Project Wolf Hunting and it looked interesting, so I added it to my LONG to watch list. But I didn’t think I would be able to see it anytime soon because I didn’t expect it to be streaming yet. To my surprise it showed up on HOOPLA so I knew I had to watch it. I am so glad I did.

I have quite a few favorite kills but I won’t spoil them now.The plot. I like the story. It’s very action packed.Negatives:The plot. I like the story, I wish they would have gone more in depth with the backstory of some of the characters.I thought this was a really fun ride where you never knew who would live and who would die.

"Watched Dual last night/this morning. Bloody fantastic film. I thought it was just going to be yet another low-brow SFX laden action thing with loads of fight scenes, not really my thing, but Karen Gillan was in it, so I thought I'd give it a go before crashing out. Not at all what I expected. It's actually a really clever dystopian black comedy with fantastic performances from everybody involved. It's getting a lot of hate, seemingly because many others thought it was going to be the same film I thought it was, but unlike me, they were disappointed it wasn't actually that. The interesting thing about it is, it seems designed to have two seemingly open possibilities of how it ended, but in reality depending on which people choose to accept, you can see how closely they paid attention and thought deeply (or not) about the film. If you want an action movie, give it a miss, but if you like cerebral black comedies, watch it ASAP!",698128,Mex5150,9.0,Positive

But it really is possible, to find someone that you can talk anything to, and feel the magic and fall in love every (date) night regardless of how exciting, romantic, awkward, “boring”, or just strange a date could be, I actually resonated with this movie that I kept getting accepted and then slightly pushed away because how intensive the love chemicals can build up. It becomes addictive, and borderline unhealthy, and definitely can be scary for the other party. Luckily for me, I did not require a stupid time machine to relive this experience over and over again to experience the mutual love that both of us were looking for.

"**_The Munsters are back with spooktacular sets and the expected silliness_**After Lily (Sheri Moon Zombie) meets Herman (Jeff Daniel Phillips) in Transylvania, her father, a count (Daniel Roebuck), is forced out of his castle. They travel to the suburbs of Hollywood by way of Paris to start a new life.Written & directed by Rob Zombie, “The Munsters” (2022) is a prequel to the TV sitcom at movie length, just with far superior production values and minus a laugh track. The three stars capture their characters superbly with their unique takes. The colorful sets are the top highlight, but the corny humor is also enjoyable (if you like the show or similar productions), not to mention the revelations on how the family came to live in the suburbs of SoCal. I think the lack of a laugh track (which, let’s face it, wouldn’t work for a full-length movie) is what throws some critics off because there’s an emptiness in those spots where you’re expecting background laughs, but they’re not there.It’s basically a mixture of “Elvira: Mistress of the Dark” (1988) and “Elvira's Haunted Hills” (2001) with Roger Corman’s Poe-inspired flicks of the 60s, such as “The Pit and the Pendulum” (1961), “The Raven” (1963) and “The Terror” (1963).As much as I like the two “Addams Family” flicks from the early 90s, as well as “Casper” (1995), I prefer this.The movie runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in Budapest, Hungary.GRADE: B+/A-",804413,Wuchak,8.0,Positive

"A perfect example of a movie that really could've fumbled if it were in the wrong hands. The proposition of a pandemic slasher doesn't sound promising, and while the script can be somewhat flawed in its exploration of the early days of the pandemic, SICK is a brutal, suspenseful, and perfectly paced thriller. John Hyams's direction elevates the material, and it makes me really excited to see him work on bigger projects. The latter half of this film, which pretty much works as an extended chase scene, is some of the most thrilling genre filmmaking I've seen in quite a while.

"I am disgusted about the mockery being made of the BLM movement and other equalities. The film is terrible and just because it is a black person belitteling the movement it seems to be allowed? It is possibly the worst film I have seem ain a long while.Basically a really bad reharsh of Big Momma's house but devoid of any type of comedy. Every second seems like the actors are trying to impersonate Martin Lawrence/ Eddie Murphy style with no success whatsoever.The intro starts with a man setting himself on fire with a barbecue in some sort of 19060's Marx brothers parody, and the outdated ""'jokes' just keep going from there.The film even goes as far as making racist Alabama Jokes about incest. Which seem pathetic and archaic the the modern society of BLM. Almost goading places with inequatity such as Alabama to be more racist. A direct joke of BLM - Police relations and even a satirical parody of the Rosa Parks incident that launched equal rights movements.There is ever the introduction of Brendan O'Carroll for what seems to be the sole purpose of making outdated 'n*gger' and cotton picking jokes.The discrimination doesn't stop there with overtones of homophobia running throughout the beginning; a gay relationship getting no sympathy in comparison with the end of the straight relationship, seeming to question its equality or even its validity at all when the charachters return to refering to each other as 'friends' after the breakup. The film obviously tries to highlight modern sociological issues but constant overconcentration of skin colour and race seems more to mock the whole matter with the goal being to increase ineqaulity not diminish it.

The dialogue is bad too, unlike good kaiju movies like Godzilla or king kong which have great human characters or at least interesting. But these are flat out boring!

"**SUNDOWN** is a new psychological mystery drama from director Michel Franco. The story follows a wealthy British family who is vacationing in Acapulco when a distant emergency disrupts their plans. The simmering tensions between the group members come to the fore as they try to figure out what is going on and how to deal with the situation. Tim Roth and Charlotte Gainsbourg give strong performances as the patriarch and matriarch of the family, respectively. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The film is slow-paced and gently suspenseful, with plenty of twists and turns to keep viewers guessing as to what is at the heart of the trouble in this family.The dialogue in **SUNDOWN** is sharp and intelligent, with the characters often engaging in heated exchanges that reveal a lot about their relationships. The dialogue is one of the highlights of the film, as it allows the viewer to get a sense of who these people are and what they're going through. There are also some very funny moments, which help to lighten the mood in what is otherwise a tense film.The cinematography is beautiful, with the sun-drenched Acapulco setting providing a stunning backdrop for the film's events. The use of light and shadow is also excellent, creating an atmosphere of suspense and foreboding that adds to the film's overall impact.Themes such as family dynamics, secrets, and betrayal are explored in **SUNDOWN**, making it a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant film. The slow pacing may be a challenge for some, but those who stick with it will be rewarded with a complex and rewarding experience.",854359,steveinadelaide l,7.0,Positive
"PHANTOM OF THE OPEN is a hilarious true story of the world's worst golfer, Maurice Flitcroft (played by Mark Rylance). In 1976, Maurice tried to qualify for the British Open and shot the worst round in history. Despite his lack of skill, Maurice became a folk hero and inspired other dreamers to never give up. Craig Roberts directs the film with a light touch, making the most of the absurd situations Maurice finds himself in. Rylance is terrific in the lead role, infusing the character with both humour and pathos. The supporting cast is also excellent.The fact that the story of PHANTOM OF THE OPEN is true is astounding and, as the plot unfolds, it becomes increasingly jaw-dropping. This is a feel-good film with a message that will resonate with anyone who has ever had a dream. It's also extremely funny and very entertaining. Even if you're not a fan of golf, PHANTOM OF THE OPEN is sure to make you laugh. It's the perfect feel-good movie that will leave you feeling inspired.

His style is reminiscent of Tarantino and a maybe Rob Zombie, but with some artsy flair akin to, say, Darren Aronofsky.Flicks like “Psycho III” (1986), ""True Romance"" (1993), “Chasers” (1994), ""Love and a .45"" (1994), ""Kalifornia"" (1993) and a little ""The Hot Spot"" (1990) come to mind, along with a bit o’ “Ravenous” (1999). Schaech as Chisos is even reminiscent of Neal McDonough in “Ravenous.” As far as I’m concerned, “Frank and Penelope” is the best of all of ’em (it’s at least on par with the top ones).To be expected with such a list, there’s an amount of sleaze, violence, ugliness and twistedness that you’ll have to roll with, but there are also glimpses of beauty and light. For instance, lust and love are contrasted.Speaking of beauty, Caylee is a revelation in the tradition of Marilyn Monroe. And the desolate West Texas locations are scenic while the bright palette is a highlight. I’m so glad that fad of a muted colors from a dozen years ago is (hopefully) over. I should add that lovely Sydney Scotia is also featured in the fairly prominent role of Molly.The film runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot in Austin and Terlingua, Texas, the latter of which is in the Big Bend area.GRADE: A-",899294,Wuchak,8.0,Positive

"I guess people have forgotten the difference between the meanings of ""promotion"" and ""depiction"". For those who really don't know what these words mean: promotion means to encourage, to support something. And depiction means to show something, to make people aware of something by showing it to them.Now, Joyland, nowhere in its 126 minutes run supports or encourages or ""promotes"" homosexuality or anything that is anti-Islamic. In fact, this isn't even the only theme of the film. It covers pretty much every aspect of the domestic life of a lower middle-class Pakistani man and a woman (I didn't mention transgender persons because those poor things have only one class of lifestyle). It shows every harsh reality of our society. It shows all the plagues our country is being devoured by, those which aren't remotely related to Islam but have become a part of our tradition despite being highly toxic. These are the stigmas that we suffer from in our lives but no one wants to get rid of them because they have been here for so long that they have become normal. And a life without them would be abnormal or even disgraceful and shameful according to our ""elders"".The film does show the homosexuality that exists in our country. It doesn't tell whether its good or bad, it just shows it. The only thing that could be a negative point in my opinion would be the graphic scenes. They weren't really that necessary.In the end, I would say that Joyland is probably the best film that's come out of Pakistani industry in a long time. We need to support such films and accept the existence of all the brutalities of the society they make us aware about. And lastly, try to do something about them.",962571,farazmushtaqk,10.0,Positive
"**With more flaws than virtues, it is a very experimental film that will be seen by a minority and soon after forgotten by everyone who saw it.**I didn't have very high expectations for this film. It's the best thing to do, and I recommend that attitude. The film begins with the arrival of a young couple at a large old country house in America. He's British, she's the lady of the house, who was her parent's and has been in her family for generations. So far, so good. What is really strange is to find, hidden there, a mysterious portrait that is very similar to her new husband and that shows an unnamed male figure common to other portraits in other houses in the city. Intrigued by the resemblance, he searches for more information and seems to stumble upon a dark town secret that, somehow, has something to do with him.The film starts from a series of good premises and ideas but ends up not being able to use them and create something consistent. Justin Lange, the director, is young and still learning, and that is quite evident in his work, in a direction that is guided by indecision and experimentalism. The actors, of course, are not established stars, but Finn Jones even leaves us frankly positive notes, while Jessica McNamee and Thomas Murphy end up being the worst actors on the scene (she's not acting, she's just saying the lines, and he's histrionic and annoying).None of this is really a problem if we assume that this film is something that doesn't want to be a cornerstone of cinema. It is a low-budget film that has positive ideas, but which is really lost due to the way it does not manage to put them together: and the end of the film, perhaps the most consensual weak point for those who have seen it, is the mirror of the problem. The film goes along well, creates a mysterious and interesting atmosphere, manages to capture our attention and suddenly, without any justification, it completely loses control, becomes ridiculous and completely loses interest.",881487,FilipeManuelNeto,2.0,Negative
"My favorite from sundance. Great direction and a really funny script. This is exactly my type of humor so it worked for me most of the time. The performances are great, Christopher Abbott's still a Sundance darling. My only gripes with this film is the technical aspects of the script. It tries to balance multiple different tones at once. It was working for me at first, but it starting to get really irritating. The final 20 minutes don't even feel like the same movie tone-wise. I'm still gonna check this out when it gets a wide release, but it could've been better.",776512,andrialynn,8.0,Positive
"A brilliant adaptation of the most celebrated book in Tamil History. Everything about the film is almost perfect. Whether it be A.R. Rahman’s music or Manirathnam’s direction and definitely Ravi Varman Camera. All the actors have contributed well to an Epic Movie / Story. Even though there some continuity issues they are very minor. But the intricate attention to details by the director made us forget everything else and get immersed in the story and travel with the characters. One such thing that stood out to me is a choice of White Horse for Aditya Karikalan symbolizing that War is the place he finds peace. As I said, this is just a tiny detail that got stuck in my mind. But I am sure, everyone finds something to be awe stuck in this blockbuster. Thanks again to A.R.

"Great concept, poor execution. The images were well-done and the colors chosen to give the feeling of seeming hopelessness from the main characters.However, the story is way, way, way too slow. In fact, there isn't really a story at all. This could is a ""slice of life"" movie that feels like it's going at the pace of life.It's not clear whether the pace and chosen script were due to budgetary constraints, but as many ""winners of cannes film festival"", this is just a great idea waiting for a better remake. Many things could've been explored like the turbulent events that led to the law being adopted, a story following the people protesting the adoption and how they eventually lose, a jump forward a decade or more where taking advantage of plan 75 is normal, or a reality TV-esque documentary of the first 75 year old living the life with the money received from the scheme, etc.If you have nothing better to do, watch this, otherwise wait for the remake.",958487,YouShouldKnow,4.0,Negative

"**_Loup-garou happenings in a secluded village in Ohio_**People are missing in a lonely town in northeastern Ohio where an ex-Marine detective (Peyton Hillis) enlists the aid of a wolf expert (Joelle Westwood) after finding the gruesome remains of bodies.""The Hunting"" (2022) is a slow-burn low-budget creature feature with quality full moon ambiance. It’s a serious take on the topic of lycanthropy so don’t look for a wink of amusement. There’s a palpable reverence to the proceedings that appeals to me.Winsome Joelle Westwood is certainly a highlight, such a beautiful woman. On the other side of the gender spectrum, Hillis works well as the uber-masculine protagonist, a former NFL running back from 2008-2014.No CGI was used in the monster effects but, to be expected, they’re better than the relatively lame werewolves featured in “The Wolf Man” (1941) and Paul Naschy flicks.

One that did attempted to show the GPS technique, only to be informed that his locations did not match up.At no point does this film show anything illegal. That begs the question: if the makers really did have proof of fraud, why didn't they submit it to the FBI, or even local authorities?

When it comes to the production, cinematography, acting and all of that, it's extremely well done. But writing wise, it felt like a first or second draft. There's a severe lack of setup for even the most basic decisions and actions of the characters.

"Where to start? The last H&L movie I saw was ""DTC –Yukemuri Junjo Hen– from HiGH&LOW"" which left such a sour taste in my mouth I gave it a 1/10 wishing I could have given it a 0. A ""H&L"" movie without any fights and without any of the kick-ass music we've come to expect. A truly awful experience. Unforgettably bad.So, coming into this, I was worried to say the least (I had not realized H&L:The Worst actually came after that movie - But it still had its problems, namely the forced humor centered around a certain female character). I needn't have worried, though. This movie brings back the relentless fighting and music that, while it doesn't surpass the original tunes, is still pretty good (and for fans of the original films' music... there are a few treats). This one is all about the team-ups, though, and we get that killer crossover that was hinted at in the first :The Worst film. And it's pretty sweet!The whole thing is truly ridiculous. The characters are caricatures, the fighting is completely over the top, it's probably a bit too long, and the story is... umm, is there a story? Well, stories are overrated.

"**Red Pill? Blue Pill? Screw that, just take all the pills!**This is another entry in the small but growing sub-genre of movies that are outwardly similar to The Matrix, but secretly mock the hell out of it.First off, casting Langston Fishburne as ""The Guide"" was genius! He really does look a lot like his father after all, and when we first see him, it almost seems like he does a (intentionally bad) Cowboy Curtis impression.Sarah reminds me a lot of Enid from Ghost World. In a way this movie is to Millennials what Ghost World was to Gen X. And here comes the spoiler; both movies have a main character that's depressed and at odds with society and ultimately fails in her struggle to find a place for herself in our flawed, competitive society and both movies don't really SHOW their main character committing suicide at the end and instead show them heading off into some wondrous distant land by themselves where they can finally be alone and find peace, but if you can read through the subtext; they really committed suicide.In Discontinued this is reinforced by the title itself and of course by the actual scene of her committing suicide. So I have to correct myself, cause this movie actually does show her commit suicide (when she swallows the entire pill bottle) it's just that we kinda gloss over it, because after that Fishburne pops up and guides her through the matrix. But if you think about it, the whole matrix stuff only starts to happen after she already committed suicide.And also, the whole movie is basically a loop. It begins at the its own end and ends at its own beginning and yet the movie stays in chronological order. How is that possible? It's because Sarah is in a loop. She killed herself and now she is basically in purgatory, reliving her 5 ""greatest"" memories over and over again for all eternity or until she is finally able to make the choice to face society and face other people and face her own inner demons that those other people represent.",919849,EmmanuelGoldstein,10.0,Positive

"Watched _Hawa_ on the third day of it's release. Came out of the theatre and discussed the film with my friends. Then took a bike ride and went to a bank. Did my work in the bank and came home in a rickshaw. Took a bath. Then sat in front of the TV to watch Bangladesh's match. From leaving the theatre till watching the match, all I had in my head was ‘_HAW_A’ the film. Yes, **_I JUST CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT !!_**_Hawa_ being one of the most hyped film before release in the history of Bangladeshi cinema, made me a bit nervous thinking, will it be able to live up to the expectations? It sure did. Hawa gave me one of my most satisfying theatre experience ever. I had better experience of watching a cinema in a theatre before, but never with a Bangladeshi cinema. That makes my today's 2 hours and 30 minutes of experience in the cinema hall more special.The film started off with calmness. With stunning visuals that kept on serving my eyes as a treat. But I was proved wrong soon about the mindset I had set for the first half of the film. Most of the reviews described the first half as slow. That you need patience to go through the first half. Whereas I found the first half extremely enjoyable. Not only me, the whole theatre seemed to enjoy every bit of it. The lighter moments really clicked. The humor seemed so natural. Not just the laughs, the whole thing had a feel good vibe to it. Again the beautiful visuals helped a lot. But even though the story progressed at a slow pace, the director kept the audience engaged with enough elements.The second half is where it all happens. If you could sit back and relax with your popcorn in the first half, well that was it. No scope for that in the second half. The second half is all very crazy. The film takes unexpected turns. Tragedy, agony, shocking events take place one after another. And an angle of Fantasy that mixes with the Bengali mythology takes the film to a whole new level._Talking about performances_, Chanchal Chowdhury is a legend. I know I’ve said these words before & I’ll say it again and again. Cause if I try to use a different word every time to describe the man’s brilliance, I’ll be out of words soon. Even if I sit with a dictionary. He nails every bit of it. Sariful Razz gives back to back stellar performances. Wouldn't be unjustifiable by any means if it is said that he is truly 'A Star In The Making'. Proves his range by two consecutive promising performances. Nazifa Tushi gets a challenging role and she surely took on the challenge. Portrayed 'Gulti' with so much conviction. In fact each and every actor played their role with sheer perfection. You couldn’t have asked for more. And everyone makes their presence felt on the screen. You can’t talk about this film without praising each and every member of the cast._The Director of the film_, Mejbaur Rahman Sumon is a person that you can put your trust on. And he didn’t disappoint. It’s a craft that has been created with so much of care and patience. And the final product has come out being so perfect. The film has it all to keep the audience hooked. The director deserves all the praise for the way he shaped and presented his story in front of the audience._In terms of other aspects_, Every time the film Hawa’s name will be taken one thing that will always be mentioned with it is Kamrul Hasan Khosru’s cinematography. The visuals of this film are so soothing. How many ways can you show the sea and still make it as beautiful as you can?! Well Kamrul Hasan Khosru did that. There’s no way you can feel monotonous with the visuals despite the whole film being taken place in the same location. The cinematography of this film is undoubtedly the best among all the films of this country and there’s no second thought about it.Along with the cinematography, the background score truly stood out. Helped the cause of the story & blended so well with the visuals. The makeup, costume, color grading, CGI everything was praiseworthy. A film that was so well planned out & everyone was honest with their work. That’s why each and every sector’s good work caught the eye and blended so well to make this story come to life. You can talk about the story and make a comparison with other Bangladeshi films. But in terms of the production, there’s no chance for any debate. There’s no comparison. This one walks away as the superior._Finally_, Is Hawa one of the best films that this country has ever produced? Where does it rank among the all time greats? Well that’s a completely different debate. I don’t wanna go there. But one thing that will remain as a fact is that this film will always be an integral part of this country’s cinema. It’ll remain a part of the history. It’s an experience that we the people of Bangladesh have had so less of till now. It’s an experience that I personally will always rate so highly. It’ll always remain special, for the piece of art it is !!",925715,Nafiu,9.0,Positive

"A unique film, if you want to call it that. It's most definitely the only one of its kind I've seen to date. Calling it a film is probably not quite true to this work, though.

The images underline the events in the play, though most of the impressions are not directly related to the content.If you expect jump-scares or fast paced thrills this definitely isn't for you; but I rather enjoyed it, the imagery, the ideas behind it, the dialogue, the execution - all to the point and haunting (once it gets to the point - in the beginning it's a piss-take of just about anything).

"The Daily Wire's _The Hyperions_ envisions itself as an atypical superhero story: part action flick, part comedy. However, it merely serves as proof that being different is not necessarily the same as being good. As a superhero movie, there was a noticeable lack of super powers, the budget for which was seemingly non-existent For an action flick, the movie was poorly paced, with brief moments of action being bookended by long, drawn-out stints of dialouge. For a comedy, laughs are few and far between, with it's signature dry-wit all too often falling flat. From a writing perspective, the script was poorly written, with plot elements floating in and out of the story as needed. While the movie's more artistic touches, such as hand drawn animation, were appreciated, they ultimately made little impact on the overall outcome. Overall, I found the movie's trailer to be far more enjoyable than the actual film.

"The title should have been:1918: The American FluAlthough the origin of the 1918 flu is still divided, pundits generally believe that it originated in the United States, because the first recorded case occurred in Fort Reary Barracks in Kansas, in March 1918, and more than 500 American soldiers fell ill within a few days.The United States had entered the war by this time, and the epidemic was brought to France by American servicemen, and soon spread among the densely deployed troops. Military personnel of various countries, especially the British army, which had colonies around the world, spread infectious diseases around the world. When the outbreak of infectious diseases began in March 1918, all the participating countries did not report them because of press restrictions, and the epidemic caused panic among the people, which was not conducive to supporting the war, and was classified as negative news that could not be reported. As a result, the military and people of various countries were kept in the dark, greatly exacerbating the spread of the virus.As a neutral country, Spain has no possibility of leaking secrets, and the military naturally has no reason to take strict press control measures, and the media tracks various social hot spots as usual. When an infectious flu-like epidemic appeared in Spain, it immediately attracted the attention of the Spanish media.",947055,richardding1,2.0,Negative

The skeptics and purists might notice the sacrifices made here and there due to budget constraints, but these sacrifices were wise choices that indicate a sharp use of resources.

"**Russell A.-** 2 nights back I purchased the video on Vimeo. I just had to post how well done the documentary turned out. I’ve followed the information about the tragedy for years.I’ve been to the cemetery, I’ve read everything I could get my hands on, and I’ve seen some pretty weird less than credible and creepy things.This documentary is gold. Years of research. Consideration for the era, the times, a fair look at the players involved, and facts. Very well done.One cannot “enjoy” watching such a tragedy. Perhaps it’s the scratching of an itch to somehow resolve the question of “Why?” To somehow resolve the mistakes of the past. Human greed? Reliance on what one thinks they know about engineering — and money. It always comes back to money. Money, power, and not scraping a failure to save a buck, or rushing something to save face.The tragedy was a “perfect storm” thankfully resulting in at least some positive changes.My kudos and thanks to those who made this documentary happen.",1092509,none314,10.0,Positive

"I was a victim of seeing the previous installment, Mark of the Devil 666: The Moralist. So I wasn't sure I would like this follow up - a direct sequel to both 666 and the original 1970 film. Same director, same cast - but 25 years later. I was surprised that it was entertaining. Not nearly the same amount of gore and torture as previous ""sequels"" (all retitled foreign films), but it has a fun energy. The general concept is that the director sends up both his own and other camcorder movies from the 1980s and 90s. Part funny, part serious, minorly gory, and two jump scares. There's a chase through the woods that actually builds up some suspense - followed by an event both gross and darkly humorous. The finale, involving a group of dumb Satanists, gets out of control, but in a wild way. I say give a shot.

"Believe me, nobody was more surprised than I was to see this film come out so well. In the past I have been one of Keim’s harshest critics. I’ve found his films disappointing, amateurish, there are some I have felt would be better left unfinished. Then, about two years ago, he released The Tax Evader. It was nothing groundbreaking, but it showed definite promise. Promise that Keim might have some filmmaking talent. But he would have to wow me in order to gain my trust as a filmmaker.And wow me he did. This latest foray into the universe of tax evasion is truly a sight to behold. The cast of characters has been expanded and the film itself is a much deeper experience. Where the first Tax Evader film was little more than a series of jokes about taxes, this installment builds upon that foundation not only in the department of comedy, but in story as well. The plot is filled with rich themes, compelling character moments, and real growth. Plus, some light political themes to think about.The only part of this film that was less than great was the technical aspect. Most shots just consist of a character’s face as they talk, and characters are never seen on screen together. However, when understanding the conditions under which this was filmed, these aspects make a whole lot more sense. This film was almost entirely a one-man production by Brian Keim. All the acting, directing, camerawork, editing, lighting, EVERYTHING, was his work. And the man had hardly any equipment, most scenes were shot by Keim holding his iPhone in his hand pointed at his face. So while it’s safe to say that the technical aspects were lackluster, Keim definitely did the best with what he had.But the technical intricacies are really a minor point. This is a wonderful cinematic experience and I absolutely can’t wait to see what Keim has in store next.",1032151,brione33,10.0,Positive

"Offensive, irreverent, and absolutely batshit crazy, Dennis and Henry are the new fourth-wall smashing heroes of middle aged Gen-Xers and Elder Millennials everywhere. Operating as equal parts buddy adventure romp, sex comedy, and show business satire, this film actually gives a rather earnest commentary on the pitfalls of dating and finding love as a newly single older man. Between the uproarious laughs, one can find a rather sweet story about rediscovering yourself when your life zigs when you expected it to zag. But don't get me wrong - this is a comedy through and through. We all know, though, that the best comedy has a little bit of truth mixed in.That is, inbetween clown / mime gang wars.It won't be for everyone but if you're of a certain mindset and don't take things too seriously (it's a comedy, folks) there's a lot of fun to be had here.",1028644,demerytaylor,8.0,Positive

"_Spider-Man: No Way Home_ isn’t without its flaws, but it is mostly exactly what it’s advertised to be. The film doesn’t necessarily redefine the, “With great power comes great responsibility,” aspect for Tom Holland’s Spider-Man, but it without a doubt gives the MCU version of Spider-Man his version of that principle._No Way Home_ is a nostalgic extravaganza that exceeds expectations and is a perfect and satisfying bookend for the first three Tom Holland _Spider-Man_ movies.**Full review**: https://boundingintocomics.com/2021/12/18/spider-man-no-way-home-riding-the-nostalgia-train/",634649,ChrisSawin,8.0,Positive
"Long awaited and very conspiricized, **'Spider-man:No way Home'** Lives up and surpasses hype, The introduction of charcters once thought cordened off into the MCU, came both as a shock and as an eventual certainty. The Pleathora of indephth easter eggs creates awonderful viewing for the spider-man fan but alienates the casual none MCU fanatic viewers. The plot is dense not in fault but in advantage, it crams in expectation with suitable comedy and light heartedness. The director created a a comprehensive journey of emotion with several troughs and many peaks leaving a sense of WOAH at the end.Overall, **'Spider-man NWH'** is a Marvel Maniac's Heaven but can ruin marvel experiences for the uniformed viewers spoiling previous films and enjoyment of them. This is not a stand-alone film and for some this amazing but for many of those seeking to enter the universe this is not at all suitable. This and the poorly grand soundtrack make it 4.5 stars.",634649,tdheath,9.0,Positive

"Wow! Loved it!I'd recommend not reading any reviews if you plan to watch it - I didn't and I'm sure glad I didn't! Spoilers inbound!Where to begin? I was not expecting to love this film as much as I do! It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats 'Avengers: Endgame' as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.The cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of 'Spider-Man' - even away from the main universe. Seeing Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire together onscreen as Peter Parker is tremendous. The film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina and, most pleasing for me, Willem Dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. I'm a fan of Dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.Onto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.This really is top tier Marvel! Would watch again, would recommended etc. Awesome!",634649,r96sk,10.0,Positive
"This is the perfect Marvel movie that isn't an Avengers film. It pays off everything thing it builds up, corrects previous misgivings and really gets the character of Spider-Man right.

Good addition to the Spider-Man franchise and a quasi-reset. Fun seeing the old guard in here with Maguire and Garfield along with their foes and at least their inclusions didn't feel as forced as I feared when this movie was first announced. The relationship between Tom Holland and Zendaya worked better than in Homecoming and even Far From Home. Will be interesting to see where the series goes from here. **4.0/5**,634649,JPV852,8.0,Positive

"**One of Marvel's absolute best!**Watching No Way Home felt like my childhood and my adulthood were embracing each other in a warm, friendly hug. The nostalgia was brilliantly balanced with advancing Tom Holland's Spider-man and developing his character. Andrew Garfield's Spider-man also received some long-awaited closure after an abrupt end to his story. The effects, action, and humor all reinforced a heartfelt film focusing on the characters' processing of loss and grief.",634649,mooney240,10.0,Positive
"Spider-Man: No Way Home is like the proverbial blind squirrel that finds a nut every now and then, except that it doesn’t so much find them as it steals them from another squirrel’s hoard. The massive combined gravitas generated by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx would be enough to save any other movie; the problem is that this film is not theirs to save, and it’s barely a film at all to begin with – it’s more like the superhero equivalent of that Pink Panther movie they made with spare parts from previous Pink Panther movies.If I want Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, why not just revisit 2002’s Spider-Man? Similarly, if I have a hankering for Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, why not just rewatch 2004’s Spider-Man 2? The latter was, according to Roger Ebert, “the best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with ""Superman""”. How the mighty have fallen. It’s great to see Dafoe and Molina sharing screen time, but once the novelty – or rather the nostalgia – wears off, we are left with only a reminder of how comparatively superior Sam Raimi’s trilogy was, as well as a testament of how downhill things have gone since then.When Molina finally arrives, following an excruciatingly dumb, seemingly endless first half hour, he does so like a godsend; unfortunately, as much as we welcome the company of someone with a gleam of intelligence in his eyes, Doc Ock’s edge has been dulled by poor stylistic choices – first, his mechanical tentacles are 100% computer-generated (as opposed to Spider-Man 2, which used CGI to enhance, but not fully replace, a set of prop tentacles), and second, Molina was digitally de-aged (as was Dafoe), though in this case, unlike for example The Irishman, the unintended uncanny valley effect might have been a blessing in disguise; after all, Doc Ock is supposed to be a comic book villain, so that grotesqueness actually becomes him.All things considered, everything and everyone endemic to the MCU Spider-Man is as flat and artificial as cardboard (our sympathy inevitably lies with the villains because, goblins and octopuses though they may be, they remain at all times more human – and certainly have a cleverer sense of humor – than any of the heroes with the exception of Tobey Maguire, and while Spider-Man may prevail over Norman Osborne, Dafoe totally obliterates Holland in terms of acting); at the same time, all the best parts are almost exclusively lifted from the work – and not even the best work at that – of a much more talented filmmaker. To put it bluntly, Spider-Man: No Way Home has absolutely no reason for being.",634649,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative

"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/dune-spoiler-free-review""Dune sets the new standard for epic cinema with eyegamic visuals, powerful sound design and score, and a compelling story told surrounded by an absolutely massive scale.Denis Villeneuve adds yet another audiovisual masterpiece to his filmography, despite some narrative-pacing issues due to the heavy exposition and repetitive yet crucial dream sequences. Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson stand out in a stellar cast, where everyone delivers performances no short of impressive.From the remarkable character work to the constantly captivating interactions, without forgetting the spectacle of the riveting action/war scenes, the extremely layered screenplay is beautifully translated to the big screen, where every viewer should definitely go to watch this movie.Finally, don't forget that epic sci-fi/fantasy films are quite rare, so enjoy them as much as you can when they come out, instead of worrying about the comparisons with other sagas.There's enough space to love them all.""Rating: A-",438631,msbreviews,8.0,Positive
"I'll open by saying I am not a fan of Villeneuve. In fact, I think he's a hack whose only genuine talent is making stupid people falsely think they are actually quite smart. I am also a HUGE Dune fan. They have been my favourite series of books since I first discovered them as a teenager. So although I hoped for the best with this, I was expecting the worst. What I got was somewhere in the middle. It's an OK movie, not great, thankfully not terrible, but OKIt got some things right the 1984 Lynch version got wrong, but still somehow managed to get other stuff wrong (including stuff Lynch got right). It was also a surprise how much Villeneuve just lifted directly from the Lynch film, both visually and auditorily.The wardrobe choices were a huge disappointment. If you didn't know the time setting, going just on the clothes in the new Dune you'd be forgiven for thinking it was set a mere forty or fifty years (if that) in the future rather than the twenty thousand years in the future when it's really set. The Lynch stillsuits look futuristic, unworldly, and something that really would keep you alive in the deep desert. The new desert wear looks like they are just going to go dirt biking for an hour or two in our present-day world.The casting (completely ignoring the pointless gender swap) was good, However, with the exception of Paul, Chani, and Rabban the original casting was all better. But the original (apart from the odd decision to use the totally unsuited Kyle MacLachlan) was a masterclass in how to cast the perfect people for the role.Anyway, enough of the comparisons, This film is about the first two-thirds of the first novel. I always thought the story would be better told via a big-budget TV series (or even mini-series) rather than a standalone movie. I still think what they tried to cover here was too much for a single movie, but it was a step in the right direction.The film mainly sticks to the book story but does make some needless changes, the most obvious of which being the changes made to both the gender and story of Liet Kynes, which in turn impacts the story of Chani. Most other changes are small and mainly insignificant though.The film being filmed in Norway, Jordan, and Abu Dhabi looks fantastic and very well suited to the large screen. And it's clear a great deal of time, effort, and money was put into the sets that looked equally good as the places they were meant to be.The acting was of a suitably high standard, but unfortunately, many of the Dune names and terms were horribly mispronounced. That and the Hans Zimmer fart that is played constantly throughout the soundtrack is likely to pull people out of their emersion in the movie.I was also somewhat surprised by what was left out, OK the source material is VERY dense and obviously some needed to be cut, but I don't really think it's made clear just how crucial melange is to the functioning of the empire and society as a whole. Also what (and why) mentats are is largely ignored, you may think that isn't overly important, but it is at the core of how many things are done in the Dune universe.Over all, it's not a bad movie. Despite its flaws, I still think the 1984 Lynch version is better though.",438631,Mex5150,4.0,Negative
"I read Frank Herbert's book, Dune, when I was in high school and really don't remember it much except that it was great and a little scary. At that age, I probably didn't get the subtext message.I never saw any movies of it so I decided to watch both the 1984 Dune by David Lynch and the 2021 Denis Villeneuve version sequentially. I'm going to talk about both of them here.This may not be a popular opinion: Lynch's version is **brilliant** and the Villeneuve Dune is absolute **shit**. Here's why:First, is the Villeneuve Dune slick? Yes, absolutely. I should hope so considering it's nearly 40 years after Lynch did his, for crissake.Are the character's in David Lynch's version kitschy and over the top? Yes! That's one reason it's so much better! It's Sci Fi, duh! You watch Marvel movies and suspend disbelief for incredible, imaginary super powers? All of Lynch's characters are downright gritty and believable within this particular surreal fantasy.By the end of the Lynch Dune, I had sympathy for nearly every character in the film. Even the villains caught my emotions. Paul Atreides character development was realistic and attractive.Villeneuve's characters? I felt like my neighbor came over and asked, ""Hey, can you come to watch my kid's junior high school play?"" ""Sure, Denis, just let me fill my 1-liter flask with tequila first.""Villeneuve's characters were so damned flat and lifeless that they evoked NO emotional response whatsoever. Although I occasionally sit through a bad flick, I can't remember recently watching a movie as awful character-wise, as the 2021 Dune. If I were an actor on that set, I would be silently screaming. How does a director even do this?Oh, and where's the creativity? It's 46 years since George Lucas founded Industrial Light & Magic, and Denis can't create one single, new, goddamn space machine 46 years later? (One could argue the hummingbird copter is new, but it's not so creative when you realize that we didn't even know how hummingbird wings actually worked until this millennia.)But here's the real clincher: the screenplay. David Lynch gave us a complete story. Sadly, he didn't have the final cut and disowned his film when the critics panned it. Despite the fact that Lynch is a true artist and genius, the studio took 45 minutes out of the film. 45 minutes! Even ruined by the studio, even 40 years later, Lynch's film has a clear vision and carries the timeless message that Frank Herbert intended. I would LOVE to see the original cut!Villeneuve, on the other hand, stopped abruptly in the middle of the book. I now realize that Denis is not about the story. Denis is all about the franchise money, and that sucks. As a result of the bad screenplay, this 2021 version doesn't even carry the socio-political statement it was supposed to have. I want my 155 minutes back.I don't watch Part 2s, especially when it comes to void-of-creativity and void-of-character-development Hollywood movies. You can take your bad franchise and shove it up your sci fi black hole.Admittedly, I loved Blade Runner 2049, but this is so disappointing, I may never watch another Villeneuve film again. Do yourself a favor and see David Lynch's version of Dune.",438631,badelf,2.0,Negative
"This newest adaptation of the classic Frank Herbert novel (which I've never read) has the usual amazing visuals director Denis Villeneuve is known for alongside great cinematography from Greig Fraser (Rogue One, upcoming The Batman) plus the incredible and bombastic score by Hans Zimmer has the technical aspects but void of any real emotion behind the story and, especially, characters.I couldn't find much wrong with the performances but nobody really wowed me despite having talents like Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, Jason Momoa and Rebecca Ferguson, I didn't think anybody stood out, and that includes Timothée Chalamet in the lead role. I can't say this was at all bad and have some mild interest in part two, but, and this says a lot about Villeneuve's great career, this is one of his lesser films. I'll probably at some point give this another watch, especially when/if part two comes out (who knows when that will be). **3.75/5** (rounding it, I was debating 3.5 or 4, went with the latter)On the plus side, it is much better than the 1984 adaptation.",438631,JPV852,8.0,Positive
"I was really eager to watch this movie and at the same time a wee bit concerned because I knew that I would be hugely disappointed if it turned out to be another movie massacring a classic source material.I have to admit that it was a very long time since I read the Dune books but I have to say that the movie was mostly true to the books, as I remember them, and also reasonably free of agenda driven rubbish apart from the odd replacement of some characters with “gender correct” ones for no real good reason.There is really not much point in me saying much about the story. It should be well known for any science fiction fan and it is a great story and really good material for a big screen movie despite some “critics” at Rotten Tomatoes moaning about it and calling it unwieldly etc. Probably too big a book with too many words for the small, agenda driven, brains of Rotten Tomatoes “critics”. No surprise there.The movie as a whole is wonderful to watch, the scenery is oftentimes very beautiful and the décor, the buildings, the machinery is very well done. I was surprised that the world of Caladan was portrayed as a rather austere Scottish looking landscape but after getting over the initial surprise it worked very well actually.I also like that the Harkonnen, especially the Baron, are not turned into some exaggerated comical figures but, although disgusting and despicable, they are actual humans.Overall the casting was quite good and everyone played their roles well. At the beginning I felt that Paul was a bit too wimpy, from what I remember of the book he was quite well trained and skilled already from the start, but he picked up as the movie went along.It is a science fiction, borderline fantasy, movie so there should be some special effects, right? This is a difficult movie to make special effects for since this universe is a weird mix between futuristic science fiction, fantasy elements and old-fashioned traditions.I have to say that they succeeded quite well though. The atmosphere felt just right, ships, spice harvesters, buildings looked cool and fitting the story. The way they implemented the personal shields was very nice. They didn’t go overboard on special effects and weird designs. The ornithopter was of course totally ridiculous from a scientific point of view but at least it looked pretty cool.If I should complain about something, although that is not the fault of the movie but of the source material, I have never understood how, in a universe which is obviously driven by hidden agendas, machinations and assassinations, the Atreides could just pick up everything, leave their home and put all their important eggs in one basket at Arrakis.One more small thing that I could complain about would of course be that we now have to wait two years, from what I have read, until we get to watch the next movie to get to the part were the really cool stuff happens.Bottom line, this was movie is definitely in there vying for the title “best movie that I have watched this year”.",438631,Dark Jedi,10.0,Positive

"_Dune_ was a massive undertaking due to the sheer amount of lore and political backstory director Villeneuve had to fit in a two-and-a-half-hour run-time, but I am happy to say it was executed brilliantly.The story of _Dune_ is incredibly deep, there are so many layers of political factions and relationships that it can get quite confusing at times. I had to constantly be looking up specific individuals and their ties to each other to understand the minor nuances of the story. Despite that fact, Villeneuve is still able to deliver a coherent narrative that will allow the majority of the audience to understand the overarching plot. After the buildup of the first act, the story gets cooking, and I was utterly invested.There is an incredible atmosphere present in this film. It begins as a Sci-Fi epic, following a house starting anew on a fresh planet and a new industry to conquer. You can feel the optimism and the sense of discovery in the shots due to the interesting angles, lighting, and a brilliant soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer. But as the narrative evolves so does the tone, as a thick fog of helplessness bleeds on to the screen and you can feel the dread form. This tone was quite refreshing in today’s blockbuster cinema, as each movie needs to incorporate a vast amount of unnecessary comedy to appeal to the broader audience. Dune is unapologetic about what the story is trying to deliver and gives you exactly what it wants without any concessions.The visuals are stunning throughout the entire runtime. One of my favorite scenes was during the spice extraction visit. I loved the blend of realism that was used in this Science Fiction setting. The ships and equipment look like they could exist in our own world with a few technological advancements. The fight choreography is really well done, especially the hand-to-hand combat. The final scene was epic, each fist and punch were so sharp and calculated, it was really impressive to watch in the age of jump cut action.The acting is perfect throughout the film, I really cannot point to any one character that felt off or out of place. Timothee Chalamet did an incredible job as the lead man. He delivered a heartfelt performance and evolved throughout the entire film into the confident leader the story crashendos on. Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, and Josh Brolin all did great jobs as well. I really brought the somewhat complex nature of Lady Jessic and Duke Leto, they had really great chemistry with themselves and with their son. Stellan Skarsgard had my favorite performance of the entire film. I felt entirely disgusted everytime he was on the screen, and he made the hairs on the back of my neck stand tall. He is truly a man poisoned by greed and will not stop at anything on his path to fortune. Jason Momoa does a fantastic job here too. I felt he really fit his role and his lines were delivered effortlessly, much better than his performance in the DCEU._Dune_ delivers a fantastic Sci-Fi epic that gave me everything I was looking for and I will be eagerly awaiting the sequel's release.**Score:** _88%_**Verdict:** _Excellent_",438631,TitanGusang,9.0,Positive

"_Zack Snyder's Justice League_ is able to turn one of the worst superhero movies of all time into a fantastic film filled with great action, heart, and depth.The original 2017 _Justice League_ cut was unbearable to watch, each line of dialogue felt out of place and extremely corny. I was physically cringing at almost every scene. These problems are completely wiped away in the Snyder Cut allowing for a more character focused and emotional telling of the dawn of the Justice League. The entire film is completely different, with scenes completely cut and the order adjusted to have a more organic viewing experience.With a runtime of four hours, I was really nervous of feeling bored or the movie having a large amount of filler to pad the runtime, but that is not the case. Each scene is crafted perfectly to deliver important character depth, allowing the viewer to gain an emotional connection with each of our heroes. Cyborg, Flash, and Aquaman all have very fleshed out introductions, giving the audience a glimpse of their motivations and struggles living in a world with their powers. Cyborg has a tremendous arc with his struggling relationship with his father, which gets great pay off in the end of the film. The Flash feels grounded too with his motivation for fighting crime to help prove his father's innocence. With this new perspective and tone, his quips feel more like that of an immature kid (much like Spider-Man) rather than infused comedy that was forced by the corporate overlords.Batman and Wonder Woman are great in this film, with each giving arguably their best performance as their respective characters. Batman feels like a man who has truly learned from his past mistakes and wants to gather and lead his team rather than divide. Wonder Woman is a confident bad-ass Amazon who's heartfelt and understanding presence is the glue that holds the team together. Aquaman does not have all that much of an arc in this film but has a great lead into his solo movie which is noteworthy.Not only are the hero's more fleshed out but so are the villains. Steppenwolf has an actual motivation that the audience can sympathize with and understand. This leads him to feel more genuine in his conquest to take over the world. Steppenwolf plays really well with the backdrop of Darkseid who is looming in the background of every scene of our villain. It really creates a relationship akin to the Emperor and Darth Vader. The introduction of the life equation adds much more stakes and an emphasis on what the conquest is actually about.The action in this movie is great. The R rating added more room for the scenes to be more brutal and visceral with blood and gore, and even a beheading! While the majority of the film had pretty decent CGI, there were a few scenes that looked really out of place. Especially the ones with Darkseid and his lackies, which reminded me of a character straight out of a PS2 game. This largely had to do with the limited budget and time constraints the Synder Cut was given.This film delivers on Zach Snyder's vision of Justice League, and I am so happy it exists. Although it also brings a sense of sadness as well, because the movie sets up for so much potential for the DCEU and now that future has all but vanished.**Score:** _88%_**Verdict:** _Excellent_",791373,TitanGusang,9.0,Positive
"Yes it IS better than the previous version. There are parts I was a little bored with. There are some characters that were OVER embellished and OVER acted. It was good seeing Wonder Woman move fast ... However Zack musta not known that she CAN fly now thanks to WW84. I was annoyed half the time by Ezra's portrayal of Barry Allen ... But impressed with Cyborg being so much more in depth. For all the hype of DarkSeid ... He fell flat for me... And Steppenwolf was hard to look at sometimes... Being too much CGI. I love seeing the battles with Amazons, Atlantians, and Men vs DarkSeid. I hated Amber Heard period. All that teasing of the Joker for a small 5 minute nightmare scene with Batman being a total jerk was a little let down but Jared Leto played it so perfectly it made me want MORE. Martian Manhunter... I was so happy to see him. So much potential for so much more that could have been done but WB is being Aholes and not letting Zack continue. I love the movie... It was worth it and I am sad we won't get to see more. Thank for killing Justice League WB!",791373,MonsterMartha,8.0,Positive
"**So long but so incredible! DC Comics fans rejoice! As an average movie-goer, it might be a bit too long for you.**Wow! What could have been? This movie provided a master class on stunning visuals, character development, and world-building. It's shocking the disparity between the theatrical release and this movie. Surprisingly even after the 4 hour run time, I was left wanting more. The cast was superb at making these impervious characters with godlike power experience pain, loss, and emotion. The existence of this film is cinematic history in and of itself is a miracle. A director's cut with zero studio interference and such a drastic difference from the studio's original release ever seeing the light of day is astounding. And I am so glad it did. Zack Snyder's Justice League was a superhero epic that created a theatrical masterpiece worthy of DC's greatest heroes.",791373,mooney240,9.0,Positive
"Some HBO Max subscribers were accidentally able to access, 10 days before its premiere, an hour of Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) before the movie was cut off. This is not a bad strategy. An hour at a time of this gargantuan abomination is more than any thinking person can bear. ZSJL reminds me of Ambrose Bierce's famous book review; “The covers of this book are too far apart.” It doesn't help either that half the movie seems to occur in slow motion.Superman's quote-unquote death has resulted in the reactivation of the “Mother Boxes” and the appearance of Darkseid's servant Steppenwolf on Earth. Steppenwolf hails from Apokolips, a planet that exists on a different plane of existence from the regular DC Universe, in spite of which he speaks perfect English, and his name is a German word for an animal presumably found only on Earth.Steppenwolf retrieves a Mother Box from Themyscira, following a battle of incredible proportions – not because it involves mythological beings and alien deities, but because the world of the Amazons is almost entirely computer generated, its scenery only slightly more sophisticated than an Age of Empires screenshot.How can this movie ask us to believe in a place like Themyscira, when the film itself doesn't seem to have much faith in its existence? This is symptomatic of ZSJL, much of which takes place in a setting completely divorced from the real world – and my complaint is not that it's unrealistic, because ZSJL is fantasy after all; my problem is that it's not real. I mean, it's just not there.Other than as childhood wish fulfillment, true-blue superheroes are very hard – sometimes even impossible, as with the immortal, omnipotent Superman – to identify with or care about; their physical and moral perfection renders them boring and predictable. ZSJL makes it even harder by placing them in front of green/blue screens most of the time, constantly surrounded by wall-to-wall CGI, and unconvincingly engaging enemies who are literally an afterthought – digitally added in post-production, and very poorly at that.And speaking of characters that are nothing short of caricatures, there’s Flash (Ezra Miller). Barry Allen is annoying, irritating, obnoxious, insufferable, grating. He's like a very fast Jar Jar Binks. He's like the bastard son of Andy Dick and French Stewart. If he's so quick, why does it take him so long to get off my screen?All things considered, there's nothing here we haven't seen in Avengers. Darkseid is Thanos, the Mother Boxes are the Infinity Stones, Batman is Ironman, etc., etc. The one difference is that Zack Snyder's Justice League is, though I would not have thought it possible, longer and more boring than any Marvel movie. The only thing that alleviates the overwhelming oppressiveness are the brief interventions of Willem Dafoe and Jeremy Irons, whose considerable talents are wasted on this debacle.",791373,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative
"Well, the Flash had a back story and one that made him turn out to be not the sniveling coward that he was in the first cut.And it didn't end with that horrible over-dramatic race between Superman and Batman to save more people.And it had more of a plot.So, in the end it's jut a much better movie than the steaming pile that was released...... but you're not supposed to like it because Twitter, Hollywood, the left in general and the media that supports it have all come to the conclusion that fans are evil for being fan. And making a movie that the fans want makes you evil. And the goal is to make movies the fans don't want to see, lose money on it, get praise by critics and lots of Twitter Twits, and then blame the fans for not watching a movie that you didn't make for the fans and made widely announced that you didn't make it.But the fans demanded this, they wanted to see it, the demand caused the studio to release it, and when they did the fans came out to watch it and liked it.So, despite it being far better than the original (and far too long) you are supposed to hate it because of politics... even though there are no politics in the plot.And then there is the fact that it the first release only sucked because of heavy studio interference, and so you can't celebrate as a studio being smart enough to go back and make it better for the franchise, you have to condemn it because the studio can't overcome, because that would be admitting a mistake.You have to hate it, even thought it was pretty good and fantastic compared to the first attempt.So. I don't know, I just think the salvaging that train wreck and proving it can be something watchable is pretty impressive.",791373,GenerationofSwine,10.0,Positive
Let There be Carnage!It is a not bad movie to watch. The story regarding the birth of Carnage is different than the comic but works in the time they used to show this story. The movie does not give a ton of back story on the dual villains in the story but they show the love they have for one another. The movie is short and very fast pace. It also has plenty of comedy between the hosts and the symbiotes. Overall the movie sets up for a Venom 3 and an inclusion of Venom into the MCU. If the relationship between Sony & Marvel can continue to be good fans of the franchise will have a bright future ahead.,580489,bycalvin,7.0,Positive

"I liked it very much, so I add my top ten to the already existing positive reviews. The film is great in its genre. After the first viewing, it seemed to me that the second film would be stronger than the first. Duo Hardy-Harrelson = aerobatics. In the end, from the abundance of excellent jokes, my facial muscles ached (by the way, special thanks to the translators for the texts). I'm waiting for the continuation, it's very interesting to know what other capabilities Venom will demonstrate.",580489,HenryBrowning,9.0,Positive
"Passably entertaining sequel that is better than the original though I found that one utterly bland. This one still has the issue of me checking out once you have a CGI character fighting another CGI character. However, the interaction between Brock and Venom was great and the effects work wasn't bad, though most of the time scenes were dimly lit. **3.25/5**",580489,JPV852,7.0,Positive
"I didn't get as much entertainment from this as I did with its predecessor. Still narrowly good enough, though. 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage' - great title, fwiw - does retain the fun performance from Tom Hardy, while the introductions of Stephen Graham, Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris are welcomed ones in terms of the cast; even if I think their characters, particularly the latter two, are a little hit-and-miss throughout.The action and the fact that the film only lasts for around 90 minutes mean I didn't have a negative time watching this; it is sillier this time out, which also helps. Could be a 6/10 film, but for me it inches itself into 7/10 territory.",580489,r96sk,7.0,Positive
"If you liked the movies with Kong and Godzilla, you will enjoy this, complete with CGI and monsters against humans. Get your popcorn and soda and put your feet up, this is entertainment in every sense of the word. ⭐⭐⭐⭐",399566,itsogs,9.0,Positive
"Godzilla vs. Kong is the biggest scam since Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It promises a battle of epic proportions, but doesn't have the balls to give us a winner. The late introduction of Mechagodzilla is meant to give the titular characters a common enemy, allowing them to put their differences – whatever these may be – aside and work together. They want to have their cake and eat it too.The film tries to sell us on the idea that Earth is too small for two “alpha titans.” It doesn't occur to anyone that it might be too small for just one; then again, given that both Kong’s and Godzilla’s presence lacks weight, mass, volume, and depth, neither of them can be said to take up physical space on the planet (not to mention that most of the ‘real world’ surrounding them has been as unconvincingly rendered as they have).It is, however, during an expedition to the so-called Hollow Earth that the VFX department really blows its CGI wad. There is no excess they won’t indulge in, and yet it’s not enough to hide the fact that Earth isn't the only hollow thing here – so is the script, which is unable to give us a single good reason why we should care about the skirmishes between a giant lizard and a giant gorilla.You can't have two characters fight each other just because, no matter how ‘cool’ it might seem in theory; they must have a compelling motive, lest the audience loses interest in the outcome. This is such a basic concept that even the later, lesser Rocky installments understand it. But here, Godzilla and Kong just don't seem to like each other very much; even Tom and Jerry, who at least are natural enemies, have a better excuse for their enmity.To sum up, 1) we don't know why a primate and a reptile would want to fight to the death; 2) the explanation the movie provides doesn’t make sense (I mean, Hollow Earth? Puh-lease!); 3) Kong and Godzilla are so phony-looking there is never any concern that they will hurt one another, however much they try; and 4) it's a foregone conclusion that neither is going to take a dive, needed as they are for the inevitable sequels. All things considered, why watch this movie when you can see Peter Griffin fight a giant chicken on YouTube?",399566,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative
"A strong new entry into the Walt Disney Animation Studios canon. 'Encanto' is an enjoyable and meaningful 102 minutes. The animation, as you expect from Disney, is superb and the world really comes alive beautifully and vibrantly. I like the character designs and their story, with each one having something unique about them which is neat.I had heard that some of the music from this 2021 flick has entered the charts here in the United Kingdom, though I purposely avoided listening to it as I wanted to keep it fresh for when I watched the film. Now I've done just that, I found the music to be very good - aside from ""Surface Pressure"" (no. 3 in UK), I don't think I'll be listening to any of it on my own time but - more importantly - it's impressively effective for the movie itself. ""We Don't Talk About Bruno"" might grow on me, mind.The cast are fun. Stephanie Beatriz leads comfortably as Mirabel, while John Leguizamo is a great choice to play Bruno. The rest of the cast, though nothing extraordinary in my opinion, are all entertaining enough in their respective roles - namely María Cecilia Botero and Jessica Darrow.",568124,r96sk,8.0,Positive

"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/shang-chi-spoiler-free-review""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do. Phase Four is off to a remarkable start…""Rating: A-",566525,msbreviews,8.0,Positive

"**Shang-chi** is the 25th film in the marvel cinematic universe, it is deep without canyons of emotion but also comedic (with occasional comedic failures).This film embarks the MCU into a different world where tradition intertwines with modern societal problem,the film tackles this elegantly with a few stutters at the seams. As is usual with marvel property this film is a minefield of links to past and future marvel ventures, but is done in such a way that it truly can be an entry point into the extensive universe without having seen the others.The story develops slowly unwrapping the setting but it also serves to highlight the beautiful cinematic choices Destin Daniel Cretton has made, cinematic shots build to a grand climax with a sufficiently marvel-esque battle between relatable family struggles in unrelatable places and circumstancesThe end to the fight is satisfyingly predictable and leaves a numbness upon the audience because of the climax's grandeur and its fizzle into the marvel trope of comedic endings.There are 2 Pre and post credit scenes who for the marvel enthusiasts add a great deal of pleasure adn completion to the story and set up the shang-chi subfranchise.This film through all of its achievements feels disjointed and only becomes a cinematic feat at its climax leaving the audience feeeling as if they could have missed the first 50 minutes and still understood the majority of storyline.This is an great feat of film through its inevitable cinematic, it is extremely enjoyable nevertheless.",566525,tdheath,7.0,Positive
"I have to say that this was a surprisingly good movie. I say surprisingly because Marvel (or DC for that matter) have not exactly excelled in making even decent movies for quite some time. That the woke “critics” on Rotten Tomatoes gave it high ratings was a bit of a red flag as well but not only was the movie rather free from woke ramblings and preaching but it was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch.The movie starts off in a somewhat bizarre way with Shang-Chi and his girlfriend swiping a car from a valet parking and going for a joy ride. It turns out that they are telling their story to a couple of friends and that is pretty much how this movie is told.It begins more or less right away with some nice action and it continues that away with plenty of action sequences intermixed with story telling. The action and martial arts is really good in my opinion. They are in stark contrast to the mediocre rubbish we were treated to in Snake Eyes. The latter which was quite a disappointment.This movie relies heavily on fantasy elements with tie ins to Doctor Strange, especially towards the end. Another movie that I liked a lot by the way. Thus there are of course plenty of special effects and CGI. Most of them good or very good. I really liked the beautiful world of Ta Lo. The combat scenes, especially when the rings are in action are both cool and beautiful.There are quite a lot of comical relief in the movie as well and, for once, it is not to silly, outrageous or plain stupid. It contributes well to the enjoyment factor of the movie. The washed out actor is a bit on the limit but otherwise it works well with the rest of the movie. That guy on the bus starting to film and make commentaries was quite hilarious for instance.The story? Well it is a Marvel special effects movie so one should not expect too much but the story is not bad. It mostly holds together and works well enough to tie all the action together. The acting is pretty much the same thing. One should not expect too much but it is good enough. It was nice to see Michelle Yeoh as Ying Nan though. She was one of the few cool characters in Discovery and she does know how to act.Overall I very much enjoyed this movie. It is a simple super hero and fantasy adventure story with lots of action and special effects and with the single purpose of entertaining the audience that doesn’t fall in the trap of trying to “educate” said audience.",566525,Dark Jedi,9.0,Positive
"One thing that the MCU hasn't been spectacular at is branching out into other genres. Most have been scifi/fantasy fare. An attempt at horror with ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."" Some more comedic entries like ""Thor: Ragnarok."" ""Shang Chi"" is their attempt to bring the classic Kung Fu fantasy genre into the fold. And it sort of works. It's not wholly original in the idea, but can be taken more as a tribute to the Kung Fu fantasies of old. There are some changes made to established Marvel lore, but nothing that couldn't be lived with and accepted and really are necessary for the story. The story is good, not great, the performances are mostly good. The effects...are mostly decent, but there are some issues. The constructed sets are good, but the green screens are obviously green screens.The main problem this movie has is that it shines a spotlight on a problem the MCU as whole is developing, which happens in the comics and any long running shared universe: It's getting really bogged down by its lore and interconnectedness. It not good for newcomers to the MCU and will likely only appeal to fans of both classic Kung Fu films and the MCU films.It's good. It's entertaining. It provides some new stuff for the MCU, but it falls short of actually being a great film.",566525,dalboz,7.0,Positive
"Full Review and Analysis at Spotamovie.com **The Suicide Squad – Introduction**Take the weirdest villains, give them an impossible mission, add some creepy humour, actions, colours and talent, and you get “The Suicide Squad.”If some villains in 2021 try to improve and become better people, see Cruella, for instance, we can’t say the same for our protagonists on the scene. They are looking to please the American government to gain some favour in return. However, some of them will surprise us with some good intentions and actions.It’s an exciting movie, spectacular in its genre and filled with dark humour and great character. So let’s dive into the story and some insights.**The Suicide Squad – The Story**The American government organises a secret mission to take control of “Project Starfish” in the South American island of Corto Maltese. However, a recent coup overthrew the friendly American government and, the task forces created by intelligence officer Amanda Waller needs to destroy the laboratory of the secret experiment, Jötunheim. Colonel Rick Flag leads the first team that tries to enter the Corto Maltese’s beach. At the same time, the second team leader is Bloodsport, an assassin who accepted the mission under the blackmail of the American authorities.

"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/the-suicide-squad-spoiler-free-review""The Suicide Squad is everything its predecessor should have been, boasting everything a Suicide Squad film deserves. Proper rated-R content with extremely gory, bloody action sequences, which are impressively shot and choreographed through long takes, exceptional stunt work, and surprisingly outstanding VFX. With the help of a witty soundtrack, James Gunn brings his dark humor to an expectedly hilarious level, though not all jokes land in a still generic screenplay filled with the usual cliches and formulaic developments. Nevertheless, the phenomenal cast elevates the overall picture with fantastic performances all-around, though Daniela Melchior's breakthrough performance is an absolute standout. Each squad member receives decent screentime to share their emotionally compelling backstories, transforming a superhero movie into a character-driven story instead of just a team of superpowered nobodies beating up a random CGI monster. Gunn just can't seem to miss.""Rating: B+",436969,msbreviews,8.0,Positive
"The Suicide Squad is an uproarious extravaganza filled with grotesque nom-noms, full-on naked dick shots, and John Cena in tighty-whities and it’s is the most fun you’ll have with an R-rated comic book film in a theater (or at home with HBO Max) since Deadpool. It’s the first comic book film to come along in a good long while that’s charming because of how weird it is.

"_The Suicide Squad_ is still one of my favorite films of the year. James Gunn understood what the real Suicide Squad is, the great action, the violence, with a nice balance of heart and humor. The performances made this film a lot better. I didn’t expect that enjoy this film even on rewatch, and even put a spot on my yearly ranking, and I hope Gunn makes more films like this.**MY FULL REVIEW** : https://boxd.it/2kVcop",436969,tmdb79614358,9.0,Positive
"I cannot help wondering if the writer of this movie was on a LSD trip or something when he wrote it. It is over the top crazy, weird and outrageous. It is also incredibly gory. It is a super hero / bad guy comedy with emphasis on comedy. I was thinking comedy version of Kill Bill (for the gore and killing) with supers in it when I was watching it.I have to say that I enjoyed watching it though.The movie makes absolutely no pretense of being taken seriously. The “heros” are outrageously wacky and so are most normal persons in the movie. The plot is just as wacky as the characters and this is a movie in which the normal ludicrous and illogical plot twists that the Hollywood hacks usually comes up with actually feels right for the movie.I got a bit of a what the f… moment at the beginning when the movie had but started and everything went to hell right away. That was before I had realized how much of a comedy this movie really was supposed to be. If there is a sane moment in this movie I missed it.If there was one thing I didn’t like about the movie it was the liberal use of jumping back and forth. I hate this “24 hours earlier…” bullshit or any permutations thereof.I also really didn’t like the “It’s the evil US government conducting illegal evil experiments and we’re supposed to cover it up” story line. It just typical Hollywood overused crap.I did like the action though. As I wrote before it is ridiculously gory and very very comical. So is a lot of the dialog which of course is as crazy and weird as the rest of the movie. In any other movie as large shark with legs walking on land saying “yum yum” and then eating someone, repeatedly, would be just cringeworthy. In this movie it actually works.The movie is 2 hours 12 minutes long and it really did not feel too long. It was 2+ hours of fun entertainment.The post credit scene was a bit lame though. Not at the same level as the rest of the movie.",436969,Dark Jedi,8.0,Positive
"What a surprise, after hearing such great things about this film for the past year I finally decided to give it a watch and it did not disappoint. James Gunn is such a fantastically creative director, and it is shown in full force here. Gunn is able to give each character their own artistic flair that makes even the most ridiculous characters (Polka-Dot Man) memorable. The comedy is on point, like most Gunn films, but there is a more brutal style of humor that is distinctly different the MCU humor that he has pioneered, given the R rating. I was pleased with the fighting choreography, with many unique kills i.e, the Harley Quinn escape scene. The plot is nothing special, but that is really in the background to the characters relationships that build throughout the course of the film.**Verdict:** _Excellent_",436969,TitanGusang,9.0,Positive
"The Suicide Squad is to Suicide Squad what McDowell's is to McDonald's. Suicide Squad had Deadshot, The Suicide Squad has Bloodsport. Suicide Squad had a computer generated anthropomorphic crocodile, The Suicide Squad has a computer generated anthropomorphic shark. Suicide Squad had a Latino character who could control CGI flames, The Suicide Squad has a Hispanic character who can control CGI rats. Et-fucking-cetera.These minor differences only serve to emphasize that the only real difference between this movie and its predecessor is a definite article in the title. Even the quote-unquote new characters serve to preserve the status quo, as their introduction allows writer/director James Gunn to repeat David Ayer's formula from the first film: Amanda Waller (Viola Davis), who is clearly a bigger sociopath than any member of the Suicide Squad, scrapes the bottom of the DC barrel for characters who go from feeling sorry for themselves to feeling sorry for each other.But there is something that The Suicide Squad has that Suicide Squad doesn't: an odd habit of unnecessarily doubling down. Thus, we have Peacemaker, who is interchangeable with Bloodsport does. Or Weasel, a humanoid weasel who is interchangeable with Pete Davidson, a weasely human (Davidson is possibly the only person more annoying than Margot Robbie; thankfully, his character gets his face shot off early on, which actually makes Davidson less grotesque to look at than usual).",436969,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative
"**Where the first film was a good action movie with Suicide Squad characters, The Suicide Squad (2021) truly is a Suicide Squad movie in all its psychotic, unpredictable glory.**While I am one of the few that really enjoyed the 2016 Suicide Squad, I can't deny that this movie captures the chaos, instability, and expendable nature of the Squad in the comics. James Gunn introduces the audience to a whole cadre of characters that are very deep cuts into DC lore with unknowns like Polka-dot Man, Peacemaker, Bloodsport, Ratcatcher, Javelin, and more. These obscure villains serve as perfect cannon fodder for Amanda Waller's hopeless suicide missions. These C-list villains almost scream that no one is safe. Both new and old characters constantly die throughout the film. Still, somehow Gunn manages to make us care about these obscure and insignificant comic book characters making their deaths more potent and heartbreaking. He also knows how to direct Harley Quinn better than any director who has brought the character to live action. Her insanity and charm are delightfully deranged and perfectly showcased repeatedly. With an army of bad guys, there is plenty of action and fighting to keep the runtime moving and put each squad member's skills on display. After what Gunn did with The Suicide Squad, I am excited to see what he brings to the rest of the DC Universe.",436969,mooney240,9.0,Positive
"This is quite a fun tale that sees the eponymous young lad make friends with a sea creature ""Alberto"" who is disguised as a boy. Life on the Italian Riviera is pretty much all it's cracked up to be for these friends. They do the odd bit of fishing but for the most part it's pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner interspersed with loads of gelato and fun on the moped. What ""Luca"" isn't quite prepared for, though, is discovering the true identity of his new friend - nor is he without his own secrets to keep, either! Unsurprisingly, that puts a bit of a strain on things - testing their friendship, loyalty and, ultimately, their priorities. Now of course there's no jeopardy here, but the characterisations are quirkily constructed and there's just a soupçon of teenage romance (with ""Giulia"") as these two boys become inseparable and build what we hope is a relationship robust enough to survive whatever society throws at them. There are some entertaining supporting roles - the one-armed fisherman uncle and his parents add a richness to the story that is, admittedly, a bit slow off the mark - but it is still one of this studio's more enjoyable family experiences with a message of perseverance and acceptability that is delivered, not laboured. Derivative? Well, yes - it does remind you of quite a few other maritime magical stories, but it's still got enough originality to make it worth a watch.",508943,Geronimo1967,7.0,Positive
"**Ouch and Cringe**This ""Ready Player One"" clone is just as dumb and non-immersive as the original, only here we get our hopes up in the first 20 minutes or so. We get setup nicely with truly funny video game references, top notch CGI and clever dialogue. But then the flick degenerates into the same old, same old: boring villain, plot is unoriginal, action is magic, hacking is imagined by someone not owning a computer (probably just a smart phone) and finally, the philosophical idea of a first AI ever is not explored in the slightest.I know this is just supposed to be a ""feel-good"" film, but critical thinkers will not feel good watching this drivel. Something this trivial simply does not deserve a high score, even if it does what it's supposed to.",550988,5rJoud,1.0,Negative
Free Guy was unexpected...This movie was a unexpected good movie to watch. Ryan Reynolds has quietly put together some good movies with her sense of humor / personality coming out in the roles he plays. This movie is more of a romantic comedy if you look at it as a whole.

"**Free Guy captures the wonder and goofiness of Elf, except with video games and Ryan Reynolds.**Free Guy is a fun yet heartwarming film that feels like the video game version of Elf with Ryan Reynolds playing the fish out of water goofy character with a heart of gold. Ryan Reynolds' Guy is filled with awe and wonder as he experiences things that the real world would consider mundane but, to him, are spectacular. The romance between the two lead characters is awkward at first, but the payoff at the end makes it worthwhile. All the video game easter eggs throughout make Free Guy a love letter to gamers, but the plot and acting keep it entertaining for anyone. Shawn Levy's experience with the Night at the Museum franchise and Real Steel prove his skill at making fun family films that adults can enjoy alongside their kids. Levy's lighthearted directing and Ryan Reynolds' goofy antics are a perfect combination making Free Guy a delightful movie that is worth a watch.",550988,mooney240,7.0,Positive
"The story of this movie is a pretty cool idea but unfortunately it is somewhat ruined by Disney’s woke brigade.I have to say that I quite enjoyed the first third of this movie even though said woke brigade managed to throw in some woke unnecessary bullshit about “white privilege” quite early but from there it went rather downhill.The first third had plenty of over the top hilarious action in it. It was fun to watch. The parts where Free Guy learns to “level up” and kick ass where quite cool.From there on it started to go downhill. The idea that Millie should access some “hidden level” in the game to reveal evidence that Antwan had stolen code from her is rather ludicrous.Speaking of Antwan, can you say “over the top”? Sometimes over the top can be fun but this guy was just cringey.Although there were still plenty of cool CGI effects in the latter half of the movie it was pretty much ruined for me by several completely unnecessary strongly sexual scenes. I do not need some guy touching another guys “boobs” in my films and I do not need any boob touching at all in a movie for all audiences. Overall, at this point the movie becomes more an attempt at social engineering, propaganda and agenda feeding.The ending? It was, not very surprisingly at this point, rather meh. To me the movie more or less ended when Millie’s original level was found. The rest was just dragging it out with some rubbish about being able to do whatever you wanted and nonsense about there being so many people not wanting to actual play a game (shooter) but just mill around and watch. Sorry, people wants to play games, if not to shoot things (which most people actually wants to do) so at least to do something. Not just to watch.Also the rubbish with Antwan trashing servers to hide evidence? The usual Hollywood nonsense. No way anyone, even a game studio, running a game or service that big would not have back-ups.Too bad, it was a good idea and some parts where really cool and fun to watch but their woke brigade and Hollywood script writer’s stupidity.",550988,Dark Jedi,4.0,Negative

"When I started watching this picture, I did not expect anything supernatural or something new, and as usual with films from the Marvel film studio, it turned out to be right.the authors of the script decided not to break the tradition and, as usual, took the path of least resistance, there are heroes, there are villains, they are fighting each other for the fate of all mankind. The plot revolves around the fact that a certain deity sends detachments of superheroes endowed with superpowers to protect intelligent life on different planets from evil predatory creatures remotely resembling ancient lizards, which they almost successfully cope with, but it turns out that the main characters fought absolutely the wrong evil and the main battle they are ahead. The first hour of the film is mostly banal chatter and shots telling about previous events, but towards the end there is an increase in the intensity of events up to an epic massacre of good and evil. The plot does not carry a global mystery and everything is clear from the very beginning, and small plot twists are guessed even before the viewer sees them.

"The Eternals have lived on Earth for 7,000 years. That’s a long time, but their movie somehow manages to feel even longer than that. Now, if the Eternals predate the Avengers by a few millennia, and have been actively and openly involved in various periods of human history, where where they during the events of the last two Avengers movies?Since those (mis)adventures had nothing to do with “Deviants”, the Eternals presumably couldn't be bothered to lift a finger. If that’s the case, why did they stay on Earth so long after the Deviants had supposedly been eradicated?And if the Deviants are at least as old as the Eternals, why are they called after a word in a language that wasn't going to exist until eons later? This question actually has an answer, albeit a nonsensical one: as far as I can discern English is, for some unfathomable reason, the lingua franca of the Universe, which of course includes both the Earth and Olympia.One Eternal even communicates with sign language, which I guess means she invented it. Moreover, several Eternals have an unambiguous ethnicity; are we to understand that they originated these, for lack of a better term, races on our planet?Or is it just a big coincidence that Olympia has Mexicans, Irish, Scottish, Pakistanis, and South Koreans? And speaking of inventions, it seems that ancient civilizations were more (or less, as the case may be) technologically advanced than we had previously thought; specifically when it comes to the CGI that they apparently used to build their cities.This imagery that looks straight out of Age of Empires is the reason that Eternals never generates the slightest sense of urgency (and if it did, it could never keep it up for the more than two and a half hours of running time).Who cares about the destruction of the world when the world in the first place is plainly phonier than a diploma issued by Megatrend University? Hell, the entire Universe seems to consist almost exclusively of green screens.How much respect or fear can Arishem and the Deviants respectively inspire or instill when they are nothing more than shapeless masses of pixels? All things considered, the only redeeming thing about this film is that it points out (unwittingly, I must assume) the arbitrariness of everything that has to do with the MCU: ""Five years ago, Thanos wiped out half the population of the universe ...

"This is of course social and political satire, and it is sad how much of it rings true. It can be difficult to satirize the excesses of the rich and famous — or even the redneck poor — and the social media juggernaut.But the script clicks on all cylinders a lot of the time and entertains as it eviscerates. I have always liked Mark Ryland’s roles, and this is a real departure for him as the media giant and third richest human ever. But I mostly found it difficult to like Dr. Mindy as he gradually adjusts his beliefs and personality to suit his new fame. My sympathy was with his wife and family, afterthoughts for 95% of the movie.But it was an entertaining movie and I would be willing to watch it again someday, not because of the serious issues it raised (slightly) but just to catch more of the social media and television images that flash across the screen too quickly to take them all in.

When they report this to ""Oglethorpe"" (Rob Morgan) - the man at NASA charged with coping with such existential threats, the three are now exposed to the upper echelons of the US administration that frequently elicits a smile and a grimace from the audience. The real star of the movie, Meryl Streep, is ""President Orlean"" (Yes, guess what her Christian name is?) who presides over her government with the aid of her hapless chief of staff son ""Jason"" (Jonah Hill) in what is a very thinly veiled swipe at all things Trumpian. The story pretty much follows the thread of ""Meteor"" (1979) only with better special effects, and the corporate machinations of the ""Blofeld""-esque ""Isherwell"" (Sir Mark Rylance) add quite a bit of faux-menace to this rather entertaining parody of disaster movie meets political drama by way of some manipulative and fickle television journalism (epitomised by a fun contribution from Cate Blanchett). The pace of the film is a bit hit-and-miss, but keep an eye out for a nice couple of scenes from Ron Perlman as the archetypally gung-ho, militaristic, ""Drask"" and from Timothée Chalamet (where does he find the time?) as the hippy love interest ""Yule"" that both add some bulk and humour to the otherwise quite flimsy plot that enjoys quite a really fitting end.

"The Fast and Furious franchise has, since quite a few movies back, abandoned all pretense of being anything but silly, unrealistic, action extravaganzas. That means that these movies are not to everyone’s taste (which no movies really are for that matter) but it seems a lot of those people have watched this movie anyway and then pretends to be surprised.Those who give this movie one star ratings have obviously never seen a real one star movie and those asshats that start their review with “I left after xx minutes” are just trolls. If you have not watched the movie, all of it, don’t write a bloody “review”.To me this movie was pretty much what I expected. Perhaps even a bit more silly and over the top than the previous ones, not that this was much of a surprise, but still more or less what I expected.It has a half decent, quite predictable, story that’s just good enough to tie the action sequences together. I do whish stupid Hollywood writers that probably never finished basic school would stop write stories with their favorite “device yyy which can take over all electronics” bullshit in them. Apart from being total scientific nonsense it is really, really overused.Vin Diesel is Vin Diesel. I cannot remember many, if any, movies where I have not liked his character. His team is pretty likable as well although some of their silly shenanigans and ramblings was indeed a bit tiresome from time to time.The core of the movie is of course the action and special effects. Sure, they are incredibly over the top and for the most of the time you have to put your brain in idle when watching them but if you, like me, like special effects this is a movie for you. The silly scene where the bad guys “tank train” flipped over was a bit too much for me as well but on the whole I enjoyed the action.I was not too thrilled with all the flashbacks but then I almost never like flashbacks and there was plenty of them in this movie.I would have liked Chipher to have a bigger role in the movie. She is cool as well as intelligent which is not something that really could be said about Dom’s brother. The main bad guy was just a jerk and not very charismatic.

Following a miraculous escape, Roman begins to suspect what Cipher (Charlize Theron) seems to already know; that they are all characters in an action movie. Sadly, the film doesn't pursue this direction which would be far more interesting than the Long Lost Brother tale it settles for.It turns out that Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) has a brother, Jakob (John Cena). Like the laws of physics, Dom had never let on that this brother ever even existed. Thus, we get a series of expository flashbacks to provide some background for this new character; you know, so that it doesn’t appear as if they just pulled him out of fucking nowehere.These trips down amnesia lane are what truly sinks the movie. F9 uses the format popularized by The Godfather Part II, in which Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone in the 'present' and Robert De Niro plays Vito Corleone in extended flashbacks.Now, Diesel and Cena are no Pacino or De Niro, but they are two unique individuals endowed with clearly defined personalities and who happen to ooze charisma and self-confidence. In comparison, the actors who play their younger versions are such non-entities that they almost make a good case for digital de-aging (almost). As a result of this, F9 loses all the momentum it has gathered in the contemporary scenes every time it looks back.Moreover, Cena is too obviously a Red Herring; there's a reason he played a 'heroic' character in WWE for roughly 15 years, and it's because he couldn't be a convincing villain even if his life depended on it.Meanwhile, skilled performers like Kurt Russell, Shea Whigham, Michael Rooker, and Helen Mirror are wasted in peripheral roles (not to mention Theron, who spends most of her screen time literally locked inside a transparent box, leaving us to wonder what she does when she has to go to the bathroom), the filmmakers seemingly operating under the impression that they must perforce make room for each and every character who has ever made an appearance at some point in the series.Apart from those already mentioned, we briefly see Lucas Black, Don Omar, Bow Wow, Jason Tobin, Gal Gadot, and Jason Statham in a cameo during the closing credits (unseen by me because once the credits roll, I’m outta there). About the only exception is of course Paul Walker (but not, as one might have reasonably expected, the one who had supposedly died in an explosion in a previous installment), whose character, from what we hear, has been reduced to babysitting Dom's son and his own. Is that the true Fate of the Furious?",385128,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative
"**Full Analysis at SpotaMovie.com** - When life becomes monotonous and exhausting, you need a bit of action. “Nobody” gives you one hour and 32 minutes, intense and full of frustrations, adrenaline, and pure madness. So, is there a better way to relieve your stress? Let’s find out. - **The Story** - Hutch Mansell is an ordinary man with a wife and kids. His life is not precisely exciting. His daily routine is exhausting in its boredom, and the people around him don’t let shine his best qualities. Then, one night, his life changes when two thieves break into his home in the middle of the night. Inside Hutch’s mind, there is now frustration, and the criticisms of the people around him make him feel useless and underestimated. To find himself, he needs to look into his past, where his life was different. So the other side of Hutch resurrects and with it the “best part” of himself. A night can change everything. It can bring fresh ideas, new perspectives or sometimes just troubles. And we are talking about big ones. Who is Hutch? What is he going to do?

"With exceptional stunt work (Greg Rementer, Dan Skene) and remarkable directing (Ilya Naishuller), Nobody mainly works due to the surprising casting of Bob Odenkirk (Little Women) as the badass yet vulnerable protagonist. Derek Kolstad - creator of the John Wick franchise - basically writes what could easily be characterized as a spin-off of the popular action saga starring Keanu Reeves, which has its pros and cons. On one hand, the formulaic narrative isn’t unique in the slightest, holding a cliche, weak villain, and a lack of compelling characters besides the main one. On the other hand, it features insanely gory, bloody, well-choreographed fighting sequences, where Odenkirk absolutely shines - the actor performs a shockingly impressive amount of stunts. Expectations-wise, it offers the high entertainment levels audiences crave, so I can’t help but recommend it.Rating: B",615457,msbreviews,7.0,Positive
"I have to confess that I like you-f…-with-the-wrong-guy type of revenge movies so I guess it is not very surprising that I liked this movie.People have compared it to John Wick but I do disagree with that. Sure the basic premise of the story is quite similar but that’s it. To me these are quite different movies albeit in the same genre or even sub-genre.John Wick is much more classy both in John Wick’s style and the entire setting of the movie with it’s entire secret society. John Wick is also much more over the top in the action parts. Nobody is more gritty and he is slightly closer to a normal person than John Wick.The movie starts of a bit slow actually. Well, at least in my opinion. Nobody is mostly walking around moping and looking sad. He also more or less gets beaten up right away which made me get a bit concerned as to whether this was going to be a movie I liked or not. I got really concerned when he managed to get himself tasered of all things. What the f…?Luckily he picks up on the bad-assery and it gets better as the movie progresses. Towards the end it gets really good actually, first when he frees the bad guy from the burden of all that ill gotten cash and then the showdown at the little work shop where Nobody barricaded himself together with… nah, that would be a spoiler, you have to watch the movie.The bad guy is actually quite a good bad guy. Hollywood has been really lousy at creating good bad guys lately but this one, a real far out psychopath as well as a Russian mobster, fits the role perfectly.Just to be a bit picky, a 4.9 litre 72 Challenger? Now I may of course be wrong but to my knowledge there is no such thing as a 72 Challenger with a 4.9 litre engine (also a 4.9 litre engine is really not very impressive). Did some lazy writer just pick a number?Anyway, this was definitely a good movie. Quite enjoyable.",615457,Dark Jedi,8.0,Positive
"This was an unexpected pleasant surprise. I bought the blu-ray strictly because Bob Odenkirk is on the cover and as a fan of Breaking Bad (BB) and Better Call Saul, I wanted to see what this movie was about. I had no idea of what the story was, so I started watching this completely fresh. I was entertained throughout the entire film. I was surprised how believable Bob's character was throughout. The other other thing that surprised me was Mr. Odenkirk's fitness, youthfulness and the contrast of this character with the ones he plays in BB and Saul. The story was engaging but not very original. Somewhat like John Wick as I expected but it had it's own flavor of a regular guy with an unexpected past. A lot of the film required me to suspend reality and accept that what I was watching could happen knowing that it was unlikely that it would. The villains were evil and some of the scenes with the villains are over the top but fun to watch nevertheless. The movie ends with me wanting to know more about Bob's character Hutch, his comrades and what his past was both before and after he met his wife and had a family. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Bob Odenkirk and enjoys a lot of great fights and battles in a fast action movie.",615457,Grimmbro66,8.0,Positive
"An absolute blast! 'Nobody' is a supremely entertaining action flick. Most of it actually feels fairly usual for a film of this sort, yet the way everything is presented is great! The pacing is perfection, the musical choices are fully on point and then you also have strong cast performances.Bob Odenkirk is of course (rightly) super acclaimed for that role as a certain lawyer elsewhere, so it's nice to see him doing other things. He is superb in this from beginning to end. Aleksei Serebryakov also gives a good performance, as also seen in television's 'McMafia' . Christopher Lloyd and RZA are fun, too.The action is top notch, especially the fight stuff, and the humour - whilst not in your face - is noteworthy as well. It all comes together to make a fantastic 90 minutes that truly fly by. Gimme 'Nobody 2'.",615457,r96sk,9.0,Positive
"_Nobody_ is a bloody good time, and I mean that literally. The action in this movie is on another level, so many creative shots and gruesome kills that had my whole body jumping in the best way possible. The slow mo shots were some of my favorite, allowing you to see every little detail of the atrocity that just occurred. The plot in this film is a little far-fetched, but that is kind of the point since the tone of the entire film is satirical. The entire second half of the movie happens due to chance. The one Russia entering the bus just so happens to have connections to the story's antagonist group. If you are able to stretch your imagination for this film, it can be overlooked for the most part. I really enjoyed how far removed Hutch was from his previous life in the beginning, leading him farther and farther down a path of self loathing and depression. It really juxtaposes the switch in his mind that reverted him to becoming a weapon capable of killing dozens of men at once. You can really see Hutch becoming alive again once he retakes his former mantle and that is all due to Bob Obenkirk’s fantastic performance. While this movie wasn’t perfect, it still was an incredibly fun ride and kept a smile on my face throughout the entire film.**Verdict:** _Great_",615457,TitanGusang,8.0,Positive

"A Quiet Place Part II ditches the tension and the stealth the first film was known for and introduces more monsters, more action, more characters, and more of a world that’s barely hanging on by a thread.Lee’s oldest kids become the key players here, with Emily Blunt’s Evelyn Abbott taking a backseat, while Murphy proves why he’s one of the most underrated actors working today.Overall, A Quiet Place Part II is an exceptionally entertaining sequel with quality performances and a primary focus on monster mayhem which, as horror and suspense fans, we should all get behind.Full review: https://boundingintocomics.com/2021/06/06/a-quiet-place-part-ii-review-long-time-no-hear/",520763,ChrisSawin,8.0,Positive
"**A Quiet Place Part II is a marvelous sequel that rises to the heights of its predecessor and possibly beyond!**It is nearly impossible to choose which is better: the original or the sequel. A Quiet Place: Part II expands the world of A Quiet Place outside of the Abbott farm adding new survivors and new locations. The characters become richer and more endearing as they develop throughout. There is even more to learn about the fearsome creatures as well. Part II boasts incredibly tense scenes that rival the first film that will have you on the edge of your seat and your heart pounding. There are some frustrating scenes where characters make idiotic decisions that build tension but also a slight annoyance, but alas, so are all horror films.

"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/no-time-to-die-spoiler-free-review""No Time To Die is the most emotional, personal James Bond movie of Daniel Craig's Era, holding a heartfelt farewell to the now-iconic actor. Delivering his best performance as 007, Craig finishes his memorable run in a high-stakes film with some of the best action sequences of the entire franchise.Technically, the practical sets and locations, stunt work, cinematography, and editing are all no short of impressive, working together beautifully to create magnificent set pieces.Despite an overlong runtime with an exposition-heavy second act and a terribly stereotyped villain with unclear motivations, the emotionally compelling narrative sets up a powerful third act boosted by an epic score.Cary Joji Fukunaga brilliantly directs a movie packed with phenomenal performances that will leave no viewer indifferent.

"Mortal Kombat is not just too long for a movie based on a fighting video game; it’s actually too dumb to even be a movie based on a fighting video game. On the one hand it does a Resident Evil, introducing a new character and making him the hero, instead of giving this role to an already established character – preferably one that is, you know, popular among the franchise’s fan base.And on the other hand, it dips into the same old MK well, kicking off with the Hanzo Hasashi Family Massacre – Kombat’s equivalent of the biblical Massacre of the Innocents. Only last year the animated Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge covered the exact same ground, and did it a lot better. The intertitle that follows the prologue confirms that we are not about to see anything new (Earthrealm blahblahblah Tournament blahblahblah Outworld blahblahblah).MK21 contains exactly (sub)zero surprises. The first time we see Jax, we know he is going to lose his original arms and have them replaced with cybernetic prosthetics (the only surprising thing about this is that the character's first replacement arms are quite underwhelming. Jax eventually gets something more in line with what we’re used to; the question is, why does the movie do in three steps what it should do in two?). Similarly, Kano's true, treacherous nature is no secret.We already know all this. We know it like the backs of our hands. If we don't know it from playing the game, we know it from watching the 1995 movie – speaking of which, MK95 is 10 minutes shorter (it wasted little time with pre-Tournament antics, and it didn’t even bother with a Training Montage; in contrast, MK21 includes what is best described as a tutorial, not the way you want to go about evoking a video game feel), which is to say 10 minutes better. It also had better effects; its Goro was clumsy and awkward – something like the Cryptkeeper on stereoids – but when Johnny Cage punched him in the balls, I felt it. Conversely, when Cole (Lewis Tan), the aforementioned brand-new character, fights Goro in MK21, it’s like he’s shadowboxing, and his shadow happens to be a four-armed man-mountain of pixels.All things considered, what’s the point of watching a movie where we can anticipate every important event, and anything we don’t see coming a mile away turns out to be unnecessary? For example, it's cool – pun intended – when Sub-Zero makes it hail, but that’s just a gimmick – nothing more than smoke and mirrors.",460465,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative
"OK... my wife is the Mortal Kombat fan of the family, and the fighting game fan of the family.

You play it to peacefully beat your friends to a bloody pulp... and that is where the fun is.But they added a plot.In Twister, the star of the show was the tornado. The plot was there to move the view from tornado to tornado. And in Back Draft, it was the same... with fire.Mortal Kombat thought it had to be deep. It thought it had to be something more than it a tournament. It thought the characters had to have more than surface level depth.THE DIDN'T.The Tournament should have been the star. The plot should have only been there to move you from fight to fight with a climax that shouted ""FATALITY!"" and left it at that.Instead they tried to add depth where no depth was needed... and that killed the fun of Mortal Kombat.Not every movie needs to have a plot and characters, some movies work best as mindless popcorn munching escapism.",460465,GenerationofSwine,1.0,Negative
"Full Analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/ - **Intro** - Released in June 2021, “The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It” is an American-British production that lasts for one hour and fifty-two minutes. It belongs to the genres of religion, crime, horror and drama, and it’s part of the “Conjuring Universe.” The trial of Arne Johnson inspired the movie. The film is not precisely the reproduction of what happened. But we need to remember that it’s a movie, and fiction is mandatory for our entertainment. And the film is engaging. It provides moments of pure adrenaline and pieces of beautiful cinematography and photography. Although it is not perfect, we think it deserves your time because God, daemons and exorcisms, apparently, are with us, believe it or not. Let us explain it to you. - **The Story** - In July 1981, Ed and Lorraine Warren, a couple who specialised in paranormal investigations, were helping the Glatzel. Their eight-year son David was experiencing unexplained and disturbing symptoms, which were consuming David and the whole family. So the Warren decides that it’s time for a real exorcism, and they go to document it.But something terrible and unexpected is going to happen, and also the Warren get surprised. In fact, the event degenerates into an escalation of violence, murder, and occult rituals. The case became a worldwide event because, for the first time in history, the defence lawyer brought in front of the court the fact that a demon possessed the killer. Will the lawyer succeed with her defence? What is that Ed and Lorraine are going to prove?And what is your opinion about this surreal but true story? - **Full Analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/the-conjuring-the-devil-made-me-do-it-2021-movie-review-and-analysis/**",423108,bastag,7.0,Positive

"To me this was great entertainment. A really nice rollercoaster of adventure with healthy dose of humour and fantasy.Dwayne Johnson is indeed one of my favourite actors these days and he makes a good performance as the somewhat crazy riverboat captain which is (a lot) more than he seems.This movie is meant to entertain and nothing else. I am quite happy that, despite it being a new Disney production, there’s really not much in terms of woke bullshit preaching in there. A little bit rubbish, especially at the end, but it’s bearable. Maybe Disney has learned the lesson as to how much that crap actually hits the bottom line.The movie is really a non-stop (almost) rollercoaster of action a ‘la Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider but with a more humorous slant to it. Some people complain about God knows what from the music score to the jokes to the camera movement to whatever. It’s a movie that are just supposed to entertain from start to finish without having to be deep, realistic or delivering some sort of message and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. Rather the inverse actually. It was great to just disconnect and watch the adventure and action.As I said, Dwayne Johnson did his role nicely as the riverboat Captain, Frank Wolff, but most of the rest of the main characters was quite okay. Sure, Frank’s jokes were cringeworthy but then, they were meant to be. MacGregor Houghton was at times a bit annoying but at times quite hilarious. I quite liked when Frank threw his ridiculously large luggage overboard although it was of course quite predictable.The weakest character was probably Prince Joachim who was mostly silly. He wasn’t far out enough to be a really noteworthy crazy psychopath but not “normal” enough to be taken seriously.If I should complain about anything it would be that the manoeuvres that wreck of Frank’s performed was, well, not very realistic although it was not as bad as that “handbrake turn” the idiot script writer wrote into Battleship. That one pretty much ruined the movie. Then, there’s also no way the Amazon river is deep enough for a bloody submarine.I watched this movie with my kids and girlfriend and we all had a really good time watching it.",451048,Dark Jedi,9.0,Positive

"_Red Notice_ is a run of the mill spy adventure with twists, turns, and an inflated runtime that leaves the movie feeling bloated. I was having a decent time in the start of the movie, I enjoyed the back and forth between Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds, the set pieces were great, and the plot was somewhat interesting. But after awhile, the movie got stale as the same style jokes were recycled and the plot kept being strung along. All the acting was fine in the film, but by this point Dwayne Johnson plays Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds plays Ryan Reynolds. There is no diversity in their acting, every role they take on is the exact same. In the beginning it was fine, but too much of a good thing is not enough. I found myself getting increasingly bored throughout the duration of the film, and the ending was a grind to get through. The twists at the end were interesting, although if I was remotely engaged in the plot I could have spotted it from a mile away.

"**Red Notice might be imperfect, but it is definitely enjoyable with its mega-star cast and grand adventure.**Red Notice is a fun adventure film with the biggest stars, beautiful locations, and spectacular effects while missing the mark in a few places. Still, it is an entertaining movie that is wildly enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously. With a cast boasting three of the most sought-after A-Listers of its day, Red Notice wisely focuses on these characters giving each actor a chance to grace the screen with their unique charm. The movie advances rapidly from action set piece to action set piece. The moments in between are filled with Reynolds and Johnson's playful banter that is funny but not as natural as Kevin Hart's chemistry with Dwayne Johnson. Ryan Reynolds does a great job playing his character that fits his strengths, but there are times when Johnson and Gadot's characters start to venture into Batman and Robin levels of cheesiness. Yes, Red Notice has flaws, but it really is an enjoyable film, and I look forward to its sequels.",512195,mooney240,7.0,Positive

"**Nostalgia is the only thing that will make this mess enjoyable.**Welcoming exciting new characters, introducing new threats and alliances, and resurrecting classic characters seemed to promise the next chapter worth getting our hopes up. With the return of Reeves and Moss, we had even more reason to believe! And the movie was decent... but not what we had hoped. My biggest disappointment was the action sequences. What once raised the bar on choreographed fight sequences fell below its predecessors and landed in the typical shakey cam fighting we see in many lazy action movies today. Neo's force push powers also became a disappointing solution to every dangerous situation. It wasn't horrible, but in its attempt to be meta and self-aware, The Matrix Resurrections forgot what made the franchise great.",624860,mooney240,7.0,Positive
"There's absolutely no reason for this movies to exist. It makes Reloaded and Revolutions look like masterpieces. For some reason, someone thought it would be a good idea to make a new Matrix movie with none of the core elements of the original Matrix. The original style is completely gone and the movie is visually generic and boring. The fights are messy and meaningless. The returning characters are forced into an extremely weak plot and are stripped of their original characteristics in favor of some new characters nobody cares about. There are lore inconsistencies all over the place and the overall goal of protagonists is pointless. Also, the meta jokes, the usage of footage from the original movie and the forced comedy moments are the worst things I've seen in recent history. What a slap in the face for Matrix fans.",624860,snunes97,4.0,Negative
"This is another one of those movies where I hesitated quite some time before getting around to watch it. I was worried it was going to either be another woke Hollywood destruction of a franchise or just a mediocre money grab trying to squeeze the last drops out the franchise.I was wrong though. When the end credits started to roll I found myself having quite enjoyed the movie. Sure, it does not have the wow factor of the first movie but that one was the first with an entirely new story and concept so it is perhaps not so surprising.I would say that I easily enjoyed this one more than the third movie in the original trilogy though.They have made a story with a semi-plausible explanation as to why and how Neo is back in the Matrix and why he is alive in the first place.After a somewhat slow but not at all uninteresting beginning the movie takes of with the usual stunts, mysteries and cool special effects. The martial arts scenes are really not as impressive as in the first movie but the special effects are quite cool.There is a new bad guy, or should I say program, for Neo to confront and, again, he has some new and old friends to help him. I do miss the original Morpheus though. His replacement do not have the same carisma. Otherwise the characters are not bad.The weakest character and the only one I did not like at all was the new Smith. This guy was so cool in the original trilogy. The Smith they have in this movie is just your average mediocre Hollywood bad guy.Overall a quite enjoyable sci-fi/action movie and it was nice to see Keanu Reeves back as Neo.",624860,Dark Jedi,8.0,Positive
"The King’s Man is a mostly harmless movie, unless you, like Rasputin, “consider being boring offensive”; if that’s the case, then you’re most likely going to want to demand satisfaction from co-writer/director Matthew Vaughn. This is an exceedingly long movie, yet it somehow can’t or won’t find the time or space to fit in a little logic.Consider the following. A group of British citizens go to Moscow to kill Rasputin, whom they believe to be a pernicious influence on the Tsar – and that he is, but that doesn’t change the fact that Rasputin remains the Tsar’s closest and most trusted advisor. One would not expect the Russian monarch to be too keen on continuing his alliance with England if he knew a bunch of English covert agents just assassinated, with extreme prejudice, his right hand man. Fortunately he never finds out – or at least doesn’t appear to do so; the scene where the British cover up the murder and make it look like an accident or whatever has gone missing, presumably because it was never written, let alone shot.Having said that, I rather liked Rasputin’s death scene, which recreates all manners of his fabled death (or, to be more specific, the myth surrounding it created by Prince Felix Yusupov); poison, beating, bullet wounds, and drowning in freezing water. This, by the way, is not a spoiler; first because it happens halfway through the movie (and in this case “halfway” means there’s still a very long way to go), and second because his legendary demise is so well known it even has a trope named after it.You know what else would not be a spoiler? The identity of the criminal mastermind behind the nameless organization – I would suggest OWCA (Organization Without a Cool Acronym), were it not already taken – intent on wreaking havoc upon the world; identity which I will not reveal because it should be readily apparent to anyone familiar with the Law of Economy of Characters (in which a seemingly minor or unimportant character turns out to be much more crucial to the plot than they first appear to be). I will only add that the villain’s uncanny ability to impossibly go from point A to a point beyond the alphabet, aided by little more than the requirements of the script, produces a plot hole so big a submarine could pass through it – and literally does.",476669,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative

"This wasn't bad at'all. The kids did very well as far as acting went. The special affects were very reminiscent of the past. (It seems as if they went with the same speical effects company or at least the same format--very good decision) And the story seemed to hold water very well. Personal critiques (possible spoilers ahead) : I wish the kids had busted a few more ghosts. Perhaps make that a montage, while introducing us to what the rest of the OG Ghostbusters were up to in present day. But instead of that, the script had Dan Akroyd's Ray character explain it over the phone. Maybe if the production had used the montage, the OGs' recognize what's going on and decide to show up to help. Or maybe have the girl's teacher, Paul Rudd, try and find the OG's. In short, there didn't seem like there was enough action. The girl was a bit too egg-head smart-alecky for my taste, but that could just be the oily film of identity politics Hollywood likes to smear all over recognized franchises, affecting my view on that notion. I also was kinda expecting Slimer to show up. lol I was a big fan of the cartoon as a kid. All in all they did very good with the film and honoring Harold Ramis in his passing.

"There is a low-rent movie review site we all know that I go to when I am deciding whether to watch a movie or program. I don’t go there because it is full of great reviews and accurate ratings, but rather because sometimes I find it is more revealing why a production gets poor reviews that what the actual ratings are.There were a lot of negative reviews of Old, but not for the most common reasons, such as racism, or political hatred of multi-culturalism. No it appears a lot of the negativity is aimed the director Shyamalen because this is not The Sixth Sense.I thought the movie was okay, especially since I am not a horror fan at all. It isn’t great, but interesting enough to make it worth my time. I didn’t see the gaping plot holes or inconsistencies that reviewers mentioned but never got specific about. I didn’t feel the acting was bad. I mean, who knows how we would look and sound if life itself stopped making sense to us? If what happens to these people happened to me, I hope I could be forgiven for looking shell-shocked, acting lost, or staring uncomprehendingly at people around me. Seems like a perfectly reasonable reaction to me. We are jaded by the horror and suspense movies we watch, but would we make sense as people if we were living in one?

"Old is a very unique and interesting idea as a film. That is about the only positive thing I can say about it. The entire movie feels jumbled together, the pacing moves incredibly fast and choppy at some points, jumping from one small event to another. As a viewer you never get to sit in atmosphere of what has just occurred because it rips you away into another event. The writing in this film is simply not good. There is a ton of cheesy dialogue and character reactions that just do not make sense. I originally thought that the acting was just bad, but I think it has more to do with the material they are trying to work with. The cheesy lines can be fine if that was the style of film they were trying to make, but with the very serious and melodramatic tone it just comes off as awkward. There is a very weird and kind of off-putting direction that the story goes relating to the children that just made me uncomfortable as well. It is sad that this film had so much potential, and trailers really sell that potential, but what we were delivered was far from a quality film.**Verdict:** _Bad_",631843,TitanGusang,3.0,Negative
"This has to be in the running for turkey of the year. It's such a shameless example of bad storytelling, bad acting, and product placement that they might as well just have given you a goodie bag as you (prematurely) left the cinema replete with your Warner Brothers tattoo. It's centres around the son of LeBron James being kidnapped by an evil AI. The only way he can be rescued is by LBJ and his new bestie ""Bugs Bunny"" putting together a team that can win a basketball game against team selected by the AI. That's about the height of it - there are no characterisations worthy of note amongst the humans, and though it is quite nice to see some of Warner's cartoon characters on a big screen again, any nostalgia that evokes is soon washed away by the sheer naffness of this whole enterprise.

"**An excuse for yet another CGI animated film.**I think this movie shouldn't have been made the way it was made. The secret to the success of the first “Space Jam” was its originality and the way it combined the drawings and a real basketball star in a movie where he could play a little with himself. Here, what we have disappoints anyone and only serves to raise money for the public without delivering a product that truly meets expectations.The film's biggest problem is obviously its script: it all starts when LeBron James, a basketball player, turns down a contract with Warner Bros. The contract was crafted by a computer algorithm that has somehow taken on a life and will of its own, and is determined to make itself noticed, even in the worst ways. By imprisoning the sportsman and his son in a digital universe, things get complicated. James will have to play basketball against the live algorithm, and he will ask the only one who might possibly have a good idea for help: Bugs Bunny. It is, as we can see, a basic script, very poorly written and poorly designed, which is not able to properly sustain the film.I don't want to be mean to LeBron James. He's not an actor, he's not expected to do a great job as an actor. I think he did a lot with what he got, which was pretty bad, but I also think he's not famous enough to support the movie the way Air Jordan did before. Maybe he's famous in the USA! Outside the US, no one knows who he is. Don Cheadle, thus, ends up being the most prominent actor in the film, even if in a Machiavellian and tiresome character. Cedric Joe does what he can, but his character is terrible, and it was very poorly thought out. Self-centered, selfish, vain and resentful of his father, the kid is nasty almost until the end.Technically, the film bets everything on the CGI of great visual effect and fails completely: if there's one thing that doesn't work well, it is the stylized and tiresome look of this film. I've acquired a special dislike for the computerized versions of Bugs and the rest of Looney Tunes. They are terrible and ugly. There are things that shouldn't be modernized, so they don't lose their essence! In addition, the film has tiresome cinematography and is excessively long, with no script or material to fully justify it. I liked, however, the many tributes that are made to the films of the past of the Warner studio: we have everything from “King Kong” to “Casablanca”, with the passage guaranteed by the “Harry Potter” franchise to “Matrix” and “Mad Max”. It was the part of the movie that I found most sympathetic and honorable, but I still don't recommend this movie.",379686,FilipeManuelNeto,1.0,Negative
"The only good thing about Zack Snyder's masturbatory exercise Army of the Dead, is that it's comparatively shorter than his version of Justice League – but what movie isn't? An hour and a half short of a four-hour movie is still too long, especially considering that if everything we've seen before were edited out of the film, AotD would be a short feature.True, we may not have seen a heist/zombie apocalypse movie, but we've seen dozens of heists and dozens of zombie apocalypses, and bringing the two genres together only serves to highlight the inconsistencies of each. But, let us start at the beginning. A US military convoy is transporting an unknown cargo from Area 51. The two soldiers in the cab of the truck debate the contents of the box (“the original draft of the Constitution written in the blood of the Founding Fathers… Amelia Earhart, long live "", etc.). Whatever it is, it’s highly inflammable, judging by how the truck instantly turns into a huge ball of fire the moment it makes contact with a considerably smaller vehicle.Actually it is some kind of superhuman zombie that kills a bunch of soldiers and infects two of them. This entire scenario could easily have unfolded without the arbitrary and random explosion; the gigantic fireball is here solely because Snyder is such an impatient director that, in a 140-minute film, he can't wait even five minutes before blowing something to bits – the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculation.On the other hand, Snyder takes his time on plot points that we all know by heart. Hero is offered a job. Hero turns down job. Hero changes his mind and takes the job. Hero assembles team. And so on and so forth. So as to leave no cliché unused, the hero also has an estranged daughter, Kate (Ella Purnell); this, however, deserves some more attention.Kate works in a quarantine camp for zombies, which is nothing short of a logic-defying concept. It is first established that the zombie bite takes immediate effect, transforming the victim into another zombie – and one does not quarantine a zombie; one shoots a zombie in the head and moves on.Now, it has always been a habit of zombie movies to play fast and loose, depending on the requirements of the script, with the time it takes for a bite to kick in, but two wrongs don’t make a right. All things considered, AotD is a rip-off that makes it a point of ripping off bad ideas – which might be all right if it were a parody, but the movie is too bloated and excessive to ever be able to take itself lightly.",503736,tmdb28039023,1.0,Negative
"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.msbreviews.com/movie-reviews/finch-spoiler-free-review""Finch is far from being the most impressive, imaginative post-apocalyptic, survival film, but it's still a captivating, character-driven story that boasts an emotionally resonant, meaningful personal journey.Tom Hanks proves to still be in shape by delivering a genuine performance as a man who teaches and learns about companionship, human bonding, and perseverance of love and life.Focusing on the relationships between Finch, the adorable dog, and the witty robot (excellently voiced by Caleb Landry Jones), Miguel Sapochnik takes good advantage of stunning cinematography (Jo Willems), exceptional VFX, and one of the year's best scores (Gustavo Santaolalla) to elevate an otherwise generic, somewhat slow movie.Despite some world-building elements being foreshadowed and not receiving a satisfactory outcome, I still highly recommend watching this subversive take on the world's ending.""Rating: B",522402,msbreviews,7.0,Positive
"Full Analysis at Spotamovie.com - **Intro** - Finch is a journey to discover life and the essential elements of it. Finch brings relevant topics on the screen, including just one actor (Tom Hanks), a dog and two robots. It may look like a simple story or static because of the apparent lack of characters, but, trust us, it’s engaging and let us think about our life and purpose. So let’s dive into the story. **The Story** - We are in a post-apocalyptical world. A solar flare destroyed the ozone, making life almost impossible on earth. Finch is one of the few survivors, and he struggles to take care of his health, his dog and his robotic friend Duwei. Finch’s skills as an engineer are good. Therefore he spent his time building a robot to take care of his dog Goodyear once he will be gone. Tornados, storms and the dangers on earth push Finch to move from its forte and find a new, safer destination. So, the journey begins for them and us. There is a lot to discover, even after an apocalypse. How will the new robot behave?

"OK, first things first - original this isn't. It is an amalgam of many road trip and robot movies that we have all seen many times before. That said, it is maybe the first actual robot road movie I think I have ever seen, and Tom Hanks and his metallic sidekick ""Jeff"" - along with their dog, make quite an entertaining fist of it. The world has been exposed to massive radiation and he appears to be the sole survivor. With an incredible storm approaching his home, he constructs his new friend and the three make for San Francisco in his heavily adapted motorhome. It's a well paced affair, this, and Hanks (who is definitely not my favourite actor) turns in quite an engaging performance as gradually he and ""Jeff"" begin to learn from each other - for better or worse. There is the sparing use of flashback to give us an indication of what happened to his family, and of how he ended up in his predicament, and as their journey progresses the film offers us a perspective on just what being ""human"" might mean as he gradually realises that all is not well. It is probably twenty minutes too long, the establishment scenes are unnecessarily extensive but, though not a great film, Tom Hanks invests just enough to keep it in the right gear most of the time.",522402,Geronimo1967,7.0,Positive

The film is based on a true story, and reveal the courage of a woman who defied a nation and made history. - **The Story** - Two old friends, Sir Jean de Carrooges and Jacques Le Gris, found themselves fighting each other in different aspects of their lives. As a result, their military career takes different paths, as well as their social status and lives.

"There is definitely something of Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" (1950) in the compelling watch that Sir Ridley Scott has stitched together here, depicting well, as it does, the rather pyramidical feudal system that provided the legal and cultural structure of life in 14th century Europe. The film centres around allegations made by ""Lady Marguerite"" (Jodie Comer) that during the absence of her war-hero husband ""Sir Jean"" (Matt Damon) she was subjected to the unwanted attentions of powerful squire ""le Gris"" (Adam Driver). By way of a legal presentation to King Charles VI, the narrative now presents us with three equally plausible tales of just how these events may have unfolded. A tale of the initial friendliness between the men and of the ambition, greed, politics and fickleness that led to their current predicament. I cannot say that Damon is particularly good, nor is the blondly coiffured Ben Affleck particularly impressive as their overlord ""Pierre d'Alencon"", but both Driver and Comer offer us strong and characterful performances as each of their stories are rendered to the Court. The different versions are largely the same, there are but subtle and nuanced variations that you might, were you to be on a jury, have to identify and evaluate - in the end there are no forensics, there is no evidence as such - it is all about whom you believe. Again, this makes the film more interesting. It's not just whom you believe, but whom you want to believe, whom you think you ought to believe. There is the powerful church to consider; the local lords - decisions cannot be made according simply to any ""rule of Law"" or ""code of chivalry"". The duel - letting God decide - is the culmination (we see this at the very start of the film before our deliberations begin), but the cleverness of Scott and the writers here is to present us with as near facts as they can - we are left to make our own assessment. We are left to look at the way in which land and people - high born, or otherwise - were pawns in a game knowingly, or otherwise, that frequently became matters of life or death. The photography reminded me a little of the recent ""The King"" (2019) in that the filthy, muddy, damp and rat-infested conditions in which even the grandees lived are presented authentically and that adds loads to the overall feel of the film. The weather being often cold and wet, the battles being fierce and bloody - all of this contributes well to the strong visual imangery. It is a long film, but I found the episodic nature carried that rather well and the last twenty minutes are certainly worth sticking around for.",617653,Geronimo1967,7.0,Positive

After one bad night in the dorm, she decides to move into a room offered for rent by an older woman, Miss Collins (the late, great Diana Rigg).

That first dream, in which a wide-eyed Eloise watches the confident Sandie secure an audition from Jack (Matt Smith), is a true marvel. The swapping between Eloise in her pajamas and Sandie in her flowy go-go dress as they twirl with Jack is a beautiful technical and choreographic achievement.

"I found that Last Night in Soho took its sweet time getting me hooked, but as the first act was coming to a close, I was locked in. The movie constantly had me thinking what was to come next, trying to decipher what was the connection between the main characters were and why this was happening. There were scenes in this film that really had me on the edge of my seat, and I have not had that experience in a long time. I did not know much coming into the film, so I expected Anya Taylor-Joy to be the lead, but I was pleasantly surprised at the power performance that Thomasin McKenzie delivered. She really displayed the full range of emotion, showing shades of a shy timid and unsure girl to being a powerful and confident mistress of the night. But not only did these dueling personalities take center stage, but her ability to capture the horror and terror her visions continued to bring on. It was an amazing and I will definitely be tuning in to more of her films. I found the plot to be very good, on the surface it is somewhat simplistic, but it is delivered very well with each piece of the puzzle slowly being hand delivered by Edgar Wright.

"Edgar Wright's most recent film is... very good!I don't love (but still like) the ending as much as the rest of it, though 'Last Night in Soho' is an extremely enjoyable psychological horror flick. The film's aesthetic is top notch, while the performances of Thomasin McKenzie and Anya Taylor-Joy are brilliant; the way their story is portrayed is real nice. Diana Rigg, Matt Smith and Terence Stamp are involved too.I do have a few lesser things to mention. The fashion college classmates being hella cartoony is one, though the only main one is the end reveal... it kinda underwhelmed me, even if there's nothing inherently wrong with it. As it happened I was just like ""well, OK..."". I think I expected greater based on what precedes. It's a 'good' conclusion, still.All in all, it just falls short of being something I'd consider as 'great' but I still had a positive time with it and would happily revisit it. As for its standing in my Edgar Wright ranking, it's top three... though, to be honest, all of his movies - 'A Fistful of Fingers' aside - are good.",576845,r96sk,8.0,Positive
"Edgar Wright takes the audience on a journey back and forth from present day to the swinging sixties in this wonderful psychological thriller. Due to Eloise’s ( Thomasin McKenzie )  upbringing by her grandmother ( Rita Tushingham ) she is obsessed with the 1960’s fashion and music. After being accepted onto a fashion course at a leading London college, Eloise moves into student accommodation and shares a room with another girl on the same course. Unfortunately the two girls are polar opposites and Eloise quickly relocates to a bedsit on Goodge Street in the heart of London. The landlady Miss Collins ( Diana Rigg ) welcomes her to the property with the house rules that include no male visitors. From this position in the heart of London Eloise manages to secure a part time job and has easy access to vintage dress shops and local landmarks. However from early on we are shown that Eloise has a form of psychic gift or illness that allows her to see and communicate with her dead mother. This affliction becomes even more stronger once Eloise has settled into the bedsit. After she retires to bed Eloise is almost immediately transported back in time to sixties London and becomes a character called Alex who changes her name to Sandy. Sandy ( Anna Taylor-Joy ) has also just arrived in London looking for fame. A talented singer, blonde,  beautiful and full of confidence, Sandy transports Eloise to the nightclub scene of Swinging London where she encounters sixties star Cilla Black performing in front of an audience. Jack ( Matt Smith ) a handsome, playboy talent manager spots Sandy and the two quickly form a relationship. However as the evening draws to a close and Sandy and Jack passionately embrace, Eloise is abruptly awoken by her alarm and is back in her own bed. Initially what was perceived as just a dream becomes more unnerving when it is pointed out to Eloise at college that she has a love bite on her neck. Each evening Eloise is transported back in time as both observer of Sandy and Sandy herself. As Eloise becomes more obsessed with sixties London  and the fun loving Sandy, Eloise in the present day, begins to change her look and style to copy that of Sandy. The toxic relationship of Sandy and Jack intensifies as Eloise discovers Jack wasn't a talent agent but only looking to recruit another girl into prostitution. As the seedier and more dark side of Soho London in the 1960’s begins to emerge, Eloise finds herself embroiled in a nightmare that threatens both her sanity and life.Anna Taylor-Joy is outstanding especially during the audition and earlier nightclub scenes. The soundtrack is littered with 1960’s classic hits and as Eloise’s mental state deteriorates and her actions become more erratic the music perfectly reflects action on screen. There is a very satisfying conclusion that allows the late Diana Rigg to shine and she gives a strong and extremely memorable performance as the sinister landlady.In conclusion “Last Night In Soho” is a very satisfying and enjoyable horror, thriller that until the final chapter has the audience guessing what is real and was is not and who is the actual antagonist.",576845,tensharpe,8.0,Positive

I found this 158 minute flick to have positive pacing, the film doesn't necessarily fly by but it does keep flowing along nicely.I, however, didn't like the music, there are some strange choices in there which I don't think quite fit the vibe of the film. It also felt odd a few times to have everyone speaking English with accents, especially when in Italy. I also would've liked more regular notices of location/year of certain scenes, not that it was hard to figure out but a few scenes, despite being set elsewhere/at another time, felt mashed into one sometimes.Those negatives aren't major ones, though, as I did get the required entertainment from this Ridley Scott film.",644495,r96sk,8.0,Positive
"The duration of _Nightmare Alley_ may seem like a slog even as you’re watching it. On one hand, your mindset is essentially, “How many times do I have to watch Bradley Cooper read a book and point at his temple over and over for two and a half hours?”But _Nightmare Alley_ is expertly crafted in a way that every sequence feels relevant later on and it leaves you with a lot to ponder after it ends. It’s a beautiful film with an incredible cast full of strong performances from del Toro regulars.It may feel like an extreme case of a slow burn, but it’s also a rare instance where it’s worth your valuable time and the investment. The audience being in on the con from the start makes you feel like part of the carny family. At this point in his illustriously hellish career, _Nightmare Alley_ is arguably Guillermo del Toro’s best written film.**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2021/12/13/nightmare-alley-review-a-murky-noir-that-tinkers-with-greatness/",597208,ChrisSawin,7.0,Positive
"This is great! I loved it! 'Nightmare Alley' is a superb watch! I particularly enjoyed the beginning and end, which are truly excellent; the middle part isn't as strong, but is still top notch in its own right. I love the dark atmosphere it sets from the get-go, the sound design is outstanding - some bits are so striking and I love it! It has a quality, engrossing story to boot.Bradley Cooper leads the cast with quality, though he isn't even the sole standout of the film. He is joined by a whole host of terrific performers: Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Toni Collette, Willem Dafoe, Richard Jenkins, David Strathairn ... I could go on, simply phenomenal casting! I wanted more of them all, and yet felt I got the perfect amount too.The 150 minute run time went by incredibly quickly for me; if I hadn't known it was on for that long, I would never have guessed its length to be anywhere near that. It's a slow burn, but a slow burn done tremendously. Guillermo del Toro - this is the first film of his I've seen - & Co. did a super job, I have no complaints at all. I was toying for ages between a 9 or a 10 rating, it just about creeps its way into the latter.Just brilliant. Go watch!",597208,r96sk,10.0,Positive

"**Full Explanation and Analysis at Spotamovie.com - The Story** - The Power of the Dog, a book written by Thomas Savage in 1967, inspires the film. It’s not your typical western. No guns are involved, but something more complex and psychological. Located in Montana in 1925, two wealthy and different brothers, George and Phil, own a ranch.Their lives change when they meet Rose, a widow, mum to Peter, a delicate but intelligent guy. Different personalities and interests generate a hostile environment for all of our characters. After the chaos, the dreamed balance may rise again, but, first, the story will become intense, engaging and exhausting.What will happen between them? Why George and Phil are different? And what is The Power of the Dog? It’s a complex film, full of symbolism, metaphors and psychology. It’s well-directed, excellently performed by the whole cast.

"Full review: https://www.tinakakadelis.com/beyond-the-cinerama-dome/2021/12/28/not-quiet-on-the-western-front-the-power-of-the-dog-review The film centers on two brothers, Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Burbank (Jesse Plemmons) in 1925 Montana. They’re wealthy ranchers who are polar opposites. Where Phil is brutal and ruthless, George is kind and quiet. Their relationship splinters when George marries Rose, a widow (Kirsten Dunst). Campion makes you believe that this is where the meat of the movie will be, in this fractured brotherly relationship, and for a while it is. It’s a fascinating look at two versions of masculinity at odds with each other in a world that could be considered the peak of masculinity. I couldn’t help but think of Kelly Reichardt’s First Cow and Andrew Haigh’s Lean on Pete, two lovely movies grappling with the same concept of masculinity in the harshness of the American West.",600583,beyondthecineramadome,8.0,Positive
"Given I wasn't a big fan of Halloween 2018, the bar on Halloween Kills was rather low and... pretty much met it. While some of the deaths were pretty gruesome, the rest was kind of bland and character decisions as dumb as others. Like the initial sequel, Halloween II, Jamie Lee Curtis spends the bulk of her time in the hospital.There was also a scene early on when Michael fights a bunch of firefighters just came off as silly looking, maybe because I'm so used to seeing him butcher people one by one, the shot, beyond being clumsily choreographed, showed him taking on 5-6 people; just looked strange.I don't know, there's not a whole lot to this sequel and like Halloween '18, not sure I look forward to revisiting. **2.0/5**",610253,JPV852,4.0,Negative

"Full Analysis at https://www.spotamovie.com/ - **Introduction** - “The Guilty” is an American movie released in 2021. It lasts for one hour and thirty minutes, and it belongs to the categories of Crime, Psychological Drama and Thriller. It’s the American remake of the 2018 Danish film “Den Skyldige.” The film takes place in one single day, mostly in one location. It’s intense, full of tensions, and won’t make you bored. Jake Gyllenhaal does a fantastic job in the role of Joe Baylor. The director Antoine Fuqua delivered an enjoyable movie, with some good metaphors and enforcing pace in the story. - **The Story** - Joe Baylor is a policeman working at the 911. He is living a challenging moment in his life, and one day he receives a call that will change his story forever. A husband has abducted his wife, and she calls the police looking for help because it’s a matter of life or death. Unfortunately, Joe takes the case almost as it was something personal, without the necessary distance to provide support and escalate the incident to the right people. In a crescendo of events, tension and problems, Joe will need to strive against his past to help this woman. Will Joe save her?

"_The Guilty_ is a gripping experience but runs out of steam before crossing the finish line.Jake Gyllenhaal did such a fantastic job in this film. The complex emotion that he displayed here was an absolute clinic on acting. He transitioned from shock to anger to sadness with ease, demonstrating the true emotions of a person dealing with a difficult situation while simultaneously being haunted by the past. It was brilliant the way he carried the entire film with just him, his phone, and the same dispatcher room for 90 minutes. Gyllenhaal wasn't the only one who was excellent but the entire ensemble of actors doing voice work over the phone were incredibly solid.I really enjoyed the story of this film; we've seen the whole one man act before, but this was incredibly engaging. I was completely locked in at parts leaning on the edge of every word delivered over the phone as the pieces of the puzzle slowly start to unravel. It was very fun to be a part of the investigation and continually having to alter my theories based on new information. Although, once the big reveal occurs, the movie overstays its welcome. It lingers on Joe for a little bit too long and I was waiting for it to be over. Not a great sign.Regardless of the lulls in the script, The Guilty still found a way to keep me mostly engaged throughout the majority of the film. Which is a testament to the amazing performances from Gyllenhaal and the rest of the cast.**Verdict:** _Good_**Score:** _75%_",567748,TitanGusang,7.0,Positive
"Well, I don't want to say it's HORRIBLE... but that's about all.For a Tom and Jerry cartoon, there is very little actual Tom and Jerry and more of the focus is on the live action actors than the animated characters. And that, honestly, is my biggest complaint.All the rest of it is exactly what one would expect. Especially since Tom and Jerry doesn't lend itself to an actual feature film, at least in length. So the plot is as cliche as you would expect, the only down side is that you expect that cliched plot to focus on the titular characters.",587807,GenerationofSwine,1.0,Negative

"Impeccably well made, supremely enjoyable.This is only the second Wes Anderson film that I've seen (fwiw, first was ' Moonrise Kingdom ' which I didn't like all that much *hides* ) and now I can better understand the hype that man gets. 'The French Dispatch' is quality, plain and simple.The ensemble cast are a delight, with many a familiar face spread across each segment and each one of them bringing entertaining performances. Frances McDormand would be my standout performer, closely followed by Benicio del Toro. Though, to be honest, all them are terrific - from Owen Wilson to Adrien Brody to Léa Seydoux to Timothée Chalamet to Jeffrey Wright. Christoph Waltz, Willem Dafoe and Bill Murray star too. Unreal casting, that!Anthology flicks can be hit-and-miss for me personally, though to be fair my predominant previous exposure to them has been via those cheaply made Disney animated sequels from yesteryear so time will tell if that feeling holds.

"**Full Review and Analysis at SpotaMovie.com**Produced and released by Apple in 2021, CODA is an inspiring movie. It delivers music and voice to deaf people, highlighting important topics. **The Story:** Ruby is the only hearing person in her deaf family. They run a small business as fishermen, and she helps and supports them, mainly translating everything to her family in the deaf signs language. As a result, she splits her life between her family and her dreams.Ruby discovers an incredible talent, something that makes her feel alive and happy. But the two worlds are not easily manageable for her because society and her parents are not ready to understand each other. Ruby’s role becomes crucial for her family, especially when a new law threatens their business and future. Therefore to keep her dreams moving forward, she will need to fight, sacrifice and change the reality around her story. Fortunately, Ruby meets an incredible character during her journey and something powerful will happen. It’s an engaging story. **Opinion**: It’s a film of revolution, passion, family and friendships.

The performance delivered by the actors is incredible and makes the movie more engaging. It's a must watch in our opinion because it makes us better person.",776503,bastag,8.0,Positive
"Admittedly, there is nothing brilliantly creative about the script, which is why I gave it only 8 stars. The elevator story: a teenager trying to find, and assert, herself in the world and her family, who itself is struggling to remain commercially viable in an industry that's been devastated by commercialism and global warming. The wrinkle in the story is that the protagonist's parents and brother are all deaf. (CODA = Child of Deaf Adults.)That's where ho-hum departs, and I have two things to say about it: First, this film deserves all the accolades and awards it's received. Second, this may the first time I've known a remake to exceed by far the original.The acting from nearly everyone in the cast is unbelievably great. The production values are fantastic. The film is incredibly hilarious (thanks to brilliant performance by Troy Kotsur), and also, surprisingly emotional. In what could have been ""just another meh coming-of-age story"", Emilia Jones worked super hard to create a character that draws the audience in.To Siân Heder's credit, everything about this production shines.",776503,badelf,8.0,Positive
"I can't say I enjoyed 'Licorice Pizza' as much as most, but this flick from Paul Thomas Anderson is a good one.Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman are entertaining in the lead roles, with Haim particularly standing out - though Philip Seymour Hoffman's kid definitely improves as the film ticks by. There are some amusing roles for more well known faces, my favourite parts of this 2021 release are in fact with one of them - funny stuff! Some parts are amiss, mind; e.g. the strange Japanese wives bits.I did find the dialogue a little pretentious I can't lie, mainly early on as we get to know the characters - once everything is fleshed out and set it's all shipshape, to be fair. The film gets a tad aimless near the end, I'd actually say the pacing is perfectly fine but it does feel as long as it is in terms of the run time - I felt every second of the 130 or so minutes.All in all, I'd recommend it. Major film buffs will lap it up, evidently.",718032,r96sk,7.0,Positive

"Calling this a ""coming-of-age"" film is like calling Bud Lite a beer. They're not in the same class. I compare this film to my other favorite re-telling of a seminal childhood memory - Joanna Hogg's Souvenir.The great Austrian poet, Rainer Maria Rilke, once wrote ""For it is not yet the memories themselves. Not till they have turned to blood within us, to glance and gesture, nameless and no longer to be distinguished from ourselves - not till then can it happen that in a most rare hour the first word of a verse arises in their midst and goes forth from them."" And that is visible here. Sorrentino writes this film in his own nameless, demential blood. I laughed. I cried. This film is one of those rare captures of the human condition.

"An enigmatic actress full of baggage plays one of the most enigmatic people of the 20th century who had a bit of acting to do herself.Diana’s stories are far too plentiful for one film - or even a series of them - so the film wisely keeps to only one chapter.It’s a slow meditation with lots of time spent on expansive and beautiful shots of an ugly situation.The big question for this film is the choice of the lead: How on earth did such as American actress like Stewart play someone dealing with the successors of the House of Stewart? Stewart shows the skills to pull it off with lots of breathlessness. Stewart spends the time being on the verge of cracking for the whole of the film and it's an impressive sight.Stewart's Diana stands out just like the way the colour of her outfits provides a pop of colour to the mostly drab setting. Performances from the support cast are minimal with dialogue between the royal family are few and far between.Music is classical and restrained with discordant jazz matching the discordant feelings going on in the rural estateThe clash of tradition and the new is at a the fore here like a flower beating against an armoured tank. It's where the new of Diana tries to prepare to enter an institution of centuries of tradition. This Diana is shown to completely and utterly not belong. The family is forever waiting for her and is even have here kept within barb wire fences like a prisoner. She desperately wants to cut these wires.Parallels with Anne Boelyn are drawn - a woman who didn’t fair too well herself. The symbolism of Diana’s home reflects her past - something that is now gone for her, but she wants to desperately get back to it. There’s a distinct lack of love portrayed in the royal family. Even the staff are models of military precision and tradition with Spall taking up the role of rules enforcer. The family and staff spend most of their time criticising Diana or ordering her about. They are always distant - Diana is mostly shown alone and needs a fantasy to get out of it.The film is ultimately very sympathetic to Diana - the royal family aren’t much above the level of monsters.",716612,M_i_c_h_a_e_l,8.0,Positive

"I haven't seen a dramatic movie that talks so clearly about the Black Panther Party, clearly its chief and its members are the conspiracy that was hatched by party members.The movie talks about the rise and fall of the Black Panther movement. If you are a fan of dramatic films with a flavor of documentaries, you should watch the movie. For a period almost centuries ago, Americans with black skin suffered from obtaining their rights, and this was also forbidden to be reflected in a dramatic, dramatic or documentary film. In America on the issue of racism and addressing it, perhaps because of the demonstrations that took place in America after the killing of George Floyd by the American company and the return of racism again to the American street.The film begins in 1969, one year after the assassination of Martin Luther King, King. This assassination changed many of the party's priorities and its goal became the overthrow of the US government by announcing the revolutionary struggle. That is why President Nixon decided during this period to eliminate the party by all possible means, legal and illegal.Many American artists sympathized with the Black Panther Party during this period. For example, the artist Jude Fonda visited the party's headquarters and declared her support for the party. Even the international star Marlin Brendo gave a speech to a large gathering of party members.Judas and the Black Messiah What is meant metaphorically by Judas in the movie is Bill O'Neal and the Black Messiah is Fred Hampton, and in general it is a projection of the story of Judas' betrayal of Christ and his handing over to the Jews.Contrary to the image that we see in other films that talk about racism against blacks, the film didn't attack white people, but rather attacked certain American institutions. The movie tried to tell the story honestly without distorting history. We saw white groups join the Black Panther Party, and here the traditional form of this type of film was broken. There is no real conflict between whites and blacks.There are a lot of revolutionary poetry and social justice, but the script was formulated correctly. The movie did not make us feel like a show movie, but rather it was a logical narration without adding spices. The story was told through the villain or the hero, and this added a new dimension to the movie. The film's director, Shaka King, performed a classy tribute to black women through the character of Deborah Johnson, and we saw how women help the men of the party in thought, knowledge, and armed struggle.The performance of the actors in general was remarkable and worthy of appreciation, and there was a very beautiful harmony between the characters. Daniel Kaluuya performed the character of Fred Hampton with utmost brilliance and deserved the Golden Globe Award well deserved, as well as the wonderful performance of LaKeith Stanfield, which showed the contradictions of the traitor Bill O'Neal.The characters I was most impressed with are Bill O'Neal, his looks are full of fear, anxiety, and a sense of shame, especially since Fred Hampton does not know his betrayal.

"West Side story: Gritty morality tale with an emotional punch. 85%Not having seen the stage production of ""West Side story"" or its first film version, which I understand is regarded as a classic, I really don't have a point of comparison for this new film version of the long-running musical theatre staple. Of course, with the US being so effective at exporting its pop culture around the world, I was aware of songs and scenes from the original Hollywood film, which had positive associations for me, even though I live in Australia.The story was inspired by a much earlier tale, which I won't mention here because...spoilers. In any case, the second film version (presumably...at least as far as US film versions go) of this story is set in a slum in New York in the 1950s (the ""West Side"" of the title). The setting is very nicely established, with an opening shot of some partially destroyed buildings which a sign states are being demolished to make way for the gentrification of the area. The flats in the high-rise buildings nearby have a suitably ""slummy"" look without the aesthetic being overdone. From out of this no man's land emerges what turns out be a gang of Anglo background, known as ""The Jets"". You can tell that they they are bad because they soon terrorise the neighbourhood with dancing and singing, with no one daring to stop them. It has to be said, at this point, the realisation of a musical in the modern era hasn't lost my interest. Fit young blokes dancing and singing and clicking their fingers in time in the streets of a big city doesn't seem all that ridiculous now.We soon learn that The Jets have a rival group which they want to remove from 'their turf', a gang known as ""The Sharks"", which are of Puerto Rican ethnicity. The basis of The Jets' animosity to The Sharks is basically an issue of race (and that is also the basis of the police department's animosity towards The Sharks as well). The Sharks do not 'belong' in the US and they should 'go back to where they came from'. The first encounter we see between these two rival gangs is a violent one and it's pretty clear that things will escalate from here between them.If you're thinking that nothing thrown into this tinderbox could make it any more flammable, well...enter Tony (played by Ansel Elgort) and Maria (Rachel Zegler). Tony is the co-founder of The Jets but after a stint in prison for a shocking beating he gave to an Eyptian man, he is trying to be a better person, now holding down a steady job and no longer involved in his gang's activities. Maria is the sister of Bernardo (David Alvarez), a man who is trying to fight his way out of the slum (literally). Bernardo has a chip on his shoulder about the Anglos, who make life difficult for his community. He plays the father-figure at the flat that he shares with his girlfriend and Maria. The prospect of Maria dating a ""gringo"" is unacceptable to him, as we later find out when...Tony and Maria meet at a dance event and...instantly fall in love. He is also the leader of The Sharks.That moment when Tony and Maria fall in love at first sight is very sweetly done. Maria, as played by Zegler, seems like an old-fashioned Disney princess at first, being very timid but then being quite forward...perhaps like a (modern day?) Disney princess? (Since I'm not well-versed in Disney films about princesses, I'll have to defer to the judgement of people more informed than me on this subject.) The lyric from the song ""Hurts so good"" by John Cougar comes to mind about her: ""you ain't as green as you are young"". Zegler/Maria is very attractive in a winsome way. Director Steven Spielberg has really captured a winning performance from her. It occurred to me after writing down my initial thoughts on this film that Zegler would be a worthy nominee for ""Best actress"" at awards time. Even though I haven't really seen many 'quality' films this year, I think I know a quality performance when I see one and I don't think that a best actress award for her would be undeserved.If you think that Maria couldn't be any more adorable, well, you should hear her sing. She has a lovely voice, in my view. To me, she's the standout voice of the musical. Elgort tends towards falsetto at times. On the subject of the music, I'd say that I'm pretty sure that if you just wanted to listen to the musical on CD or whatever, then there would be better versions of that from previous productions of this story, whether on stage or screen. By that I mean perhaps the music elsewhere is bolder, brassier or arranged more pleasingly (to my ears, at least) and that would apply to the vocal performances as well. However, since I haven't heard other versions, I can't recommend one for you.It also later occurred to me how similar Tony and Bernardo are (which I've retrospectively alluded to in my earlier comments about how both of them plan to get out of the slum). Another point of comparison with Bernardo would be The Jets' new leader, ""Riff"" (Mike Faist). They both mirror each other as far as attitudes to ""the other"" goes.In any case, just when Tony thought he was out, Riff pulls him back in again, as far as gang activities go.I liked this film and had moments of recognition with it, with regards to clicking fingers and many songs. One event which did jar with me was how Maria reacted to Tony when she heard some fateful news about him. It just didn't ring true to me. Maybe with a greater passage of time it could have worked. Later, when the police officer goes over the whole timeline, the short duration was a shock too.The film was on track for a score of 80% from me but since the drama near the end of the film elicited emotion from me, I added another 5% to my score to reflect that.Random notes:*Is the ending different to previous versions of this story? If it is, you can either read it as a return to sanity as far as character motivation goes or as a Steven Spielberg tendency.*There is some realism to the violence, so not suitable for very young children, I don't think.*I couldn't quite tell if there was some strong swearing at times or if it was toned down.*Curios: 5c for a Milky Way chocolate bar, $15 for a fashionable store scarf, I think.",511809,dfle3,8.0,Positive
"Good production. I liked the performers, except Ansel Elgort as the lead male, Tony, who I found to be uninteresting. I never got into the story or the songs.

Buddy has a special love for movies and theater, encouraged by his cranky, old grandmother (Dame Judi Dench). The beautiful relationship between the grandfather and grandmother is mirrored perfectly in the mother and father, and then again in Buddy's budding romance with Catherine.

"Let me say upfront that I am a 'Melissa McCarthy' fan, and that is probably because I enjoy her brand of humor. I expect there are some who would not agree with me but I am entitled to my opinion. Having said that, I was not disappointed with the storyboard for Thunder Force. The humor may have been geared to an older audience, but the combination of Octavia and Melissa was a good match. I found the 'woke' inserts about the two dads and the little girl, combined with the grandmother suggesting they would make a great couple to be offensive and unnecessary to tell this story.

"**_Teaching a boy the ropes of life while traveling through Mexico_**An old-as-dirt ex-rodeo star (Clint Eastwood) is given the task of bringing back the early- teen son of a rancher (Eduardo Minett and Dwight Yoakam respectively) from Mexico City to west Texas in which they have several misadventures. Fernanda Urrejola plays the boy’s mother while Natalia Traven is on hand as a woman they meet along the way.“Cry Macho” (2021) has similarities to past Eastwood flicks, like “The Mule” (2018), “Gran Torino” (2008), “A Perfect World” (1993), “Honkytonk Man” (1982) and “Bronco Billy” (1980). It’s a road movie wherein the characters get to know each other as they go from one experience to another. The nuance here is contrast of one character coming-of-age while the other is coming-near-death.There’s drama, humor, potential violence and a hint of romance. Like “The Mule” and “Bronco Billy,” it’s thoroughly mundane, but also somehow (a little) revelational and heartwarming. ""All the Pretty Horses"" (2000) is also comparable, as is ""Rambo: Last Blood"" (2019), just minus the action.The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in the heart of New Mexico (Belen and Polvadera).

You see the love interest saddened by the fact the main character regards her, essentially a stranger, as a friend but then just goes with it for reasons. This whole movie is driven by weird decision after weird decision, like the inclusion of card playing, despite the name it is nothing more than a plot moving device to explain why this weird decision has a slightly different background to the previous weird decision.All in all I feel the writer tried to do too much and as a result produced very little but confusion**Spoilers below ....

"**This idea has been repeated in many films, but it remains my favorite genre** The story of the film is about a young man named Mark who lives his life like the movies that tell about the repetition of one day until 12 o'clock in the morning, the same day comes again with the same events. The film explains about Mark's dealings with the situations that are repeated on this day, helping people to avoid exposure to bad situations that they may be exposed to.The film did not discuss the details of why it was exposed, why this particular day is repeated, because the idea of the film was repeated in many other similar films, which are almost countless because of its abundance, so the director decided to enter into the idea of the film directly. After living countless days in this way, Mark encounters a young woman named Margaret who has the same phenomenon, which is a phenomenon that is repeated today, so he admires her and they live a love story between them.Mark and Margaret decide to take advantage of this day to get the perfect moments that guarantee them happiness on this day and that give them positive energy and make them happy on this repeated day.The movie, in my opinion, is wonderful and this is my favorite genre, despite the repetition of the movie's story in many other similar films. The only negative thing about the movie is the pace of the movie was slow. The events were slow, and the director should have used the idea of the film to build events that attract audiences, such as making more comedic scenes or creating more exciting side stories.The romantic scenes were wonderful, especially the scene of Mark giving a NASA helmet gift to Margaret.

"Really good westerns are really thin on the ground these days. This has become an instant favorite of mine, both for the intelligent (though admittedly fanciful) plot, as well as for the gritty acting by the ensemble cast.This is a slow burner, building up to its explosive ending. I can’t help but wonder if the scriptwriting was influenced by Clint Eastward’s Unforgiven. A widower trying to raise a family scratching out a living on a meager farm. A man with a past that is gradually revealed. And despite it being a slow burner, it retained my interest the way that Unforgiven did. Granted, the gunfight sequences seem excessive, but that is almost a hallmark of modern westerns.There are plot twists at the end, one that is imaginative and almost breathtaking as it is revealed, and the other reminiscent of Cold War espionage films, where the heroes ultimately don’t know who to trust. To avoid spoilers, I will say no more.So I will definitely watch this movie again. It is similar to Unforgiven in that respect also.",785663,narrator56,10.0,Positive

"_**A serial killer stalks the Interstate in northern Florida**_The bodies of seven young women are found along I-10 in the Panhandle of Florida, mostly prostitutes that service truckers at rest stops. A determined State officer (Emile Hirsch) and an equally resolute FBI agent (Megan Fox) team-up to find the murderer. Lukas Haas is also on hand while Bruce Willis has a small role.""Midnight in the Switchgrass"" (2021) is a crime drama/thriller that cost $15 million and was inspired by serial killer Robert Ben Rhoades, aka The Truck Stop Killer. It combines the typical film noir-ish detective story of “Kiss the Girls” (1997) with elements of “The Onion Field” (1979), “Breakdown” (1997) and “Butchers” (2020).Both Emile Hirsch and Lukas Haas stand out on the acting front with convincing performances. A few of the peripherals are notable as well (e.g. the little daughter, her mother, the captured teen girl and the neighbor).Willis was hired for name-recognition and did all his scenes in one day, which is obvious. But, since his part is so small, it's not a major drawback. As for Megan Fox, no producer hires her because she's Meryl Streep, but rather because she's stunning. That said, I think she did a fine job, except for a couple scenes with Bruce (where they were obviously pressed for time).Speaking of Fox, I haven’t seen her in a movie for ten years. She turned 34 during shooting and is more alluring than ever. Meanwhile winsome Caitlin Carmichael was almost 16 during shooting and is surprisingly remarkable as the captive teen. Sistine Rose Stallone (Sylvester’s daughter) is also worth noting on the feminine front.The last act does create some quality suspense. While it's understandably a grey flick that focuses on the ugly side of life, there are rays of reverence, wisdom and hope. Musician Machine Gun Kelly appears in a few sequences with Megan. He must’ve worked his charisma on her because, although she was married for a decade to Brian Austin Green at the time, the two would start dating and are currently engaged.

"Petite Maman is a movie about a girl (Nelly) who has just lost her grandmother and is helping her parents clean out her mother's childhood home. She explores the house and the surrounding woods. One day she meets a girl (Marion) her same age building a treehouse. They become friends and have all sorts of adventures together.As their relationship develops, Nelly realises that Marion is actually her mother who has travelled from the past to be with her. This is a surprise to both of them and themes of family, loss, and friendship are explored as they play together. The two actors playing the children are twins in real life and they have great chemistry together. They are both very natural and believable in their roles. Their dialogue often feels improvised and their scenes together are some of the best in the movie.The element of time travel is so subtle it’s almost unnoticeable. There are no special effects, no flashy sequences; just a few small, everyday things that seem out of place. This makes the story more believable and allows the focus to remain on the relationship between Nelly and Marion.My biggest problem with the movie is the pacing. It’s a bit slow and meandering in the first half, which made it hard for me to stay interested. However, the second half is much better and the last few scenes are particularly emotional and powerful. Overall, Petite Maman is a moving and thought-provoking film with great performances from its two young leads.",749004,steveinadelaide l,7.0,Positive
"You'll feel a sense of wicked delight originating from the cinematic social milieu that Basil Joseph is so known to masterfully create as you sit down in your living room and watch Baiju and Rajesh Madhavan in their policemen characters waiting in a ""thattukada"" for a man to give him an earful, perhaps a handful. The man is a poovalan who's supposed to come down to a bus stop to meet his girlfriend. That deed may or may not happen but that is not the point of this fantastic sequence that introduces almost everyone in the film that needs an introduction.It is therefore this world-building that I want to point out that makes Minnal Murali (Lightning Murali, Mister Murali) a fresh wave into the Malayalam cinema. With equal weightage given to the primary and secondary characters (especially the central duo) and a weaving plot that experiences starting trouble but soon takes off, Minnal Murali maintains a steady pace with a mix of dry humour, heavy drama, and scattered social commentary. None of these take centrestage though as the story evolves into a bona fide superhero template that still doesn't feel trite. The background score and surprisingly well-done VFX were the highlights for me as I sat down being enthralled by the sheer magic in the way the story is written.Minnal Murali has heralded the superhereo genre with the punch that it demanded and I for one am riding the happy wave. More than anything, this is clever cinema, one that makes you marvel at all the tiny and larger bits of writing that make up this jubilant confluence. Something that you can use to forego the cliched shadow that hangs over the plot sore. You can't miss how the story evolves at a meandering pace, narrating the origin of the evil and the good equally well. Something that I don't see usually in this genre. Watch it, you'll like it.(Reviewed post embargo on 22 Dec. Watched during its world premiere at the MAMI Year Round Programme.)",657644,nairtejas,8.0,Positive
"WHenever I see Melissa McCarthy in another non-comedic role, I get more and more impressed. She is still great at physical humor and delivering funny or ironic lines, but there are layers to her performances now. Her anger, frustration, sadness, all feel real to me. This movie could easily have been rated 6 stars by me with the wrong actress playing the role.Chris O’Dowd’s role is thankless at first; he gives a one-note performance because that is what the plot calls for. The man is entrenched in guilt and depression, so there he is. But later in the movie he is called upon to develop gradually as a character, and he quickly matches Ms. McCarthy’s textured performance. The supporting cast mostly are right on the mark as well. I don’t want to overstate it; this is not destined to be in my top ten movies ever, but it is pretty darn good and I would not change the TV if this comes on while I am cruising channels.",468225,narrator56,9.0,Positive
"**The problem with this film is in the plot: starting from a wrong premise, the whole plot ends up going wrong.**There are certain films that we, even with all our good will, cannot find that fulfill what is necessary to be decent. This movie is one of them, and it's almost entirely to blame for a sadly poorly written plot, which pushes all the barriers of logic to create a story without any meaning.Normally, I save the technical aspects of a film for the end of my reviews, but this time it's precisely here that Ill start, because in fact it's in the production values and the visual effects and CGI that the film seems to me the most well-crafted. The movie doesn't have a good budget, but the effects are believable and look good enough. The settings aren't a problem either, being a story set in our time, and in an uncertain location in the American Midwest. The editing is regular, the pace is pleasant, and the music does what it needs to.The cast is mostly female, with the best performances coming from the hands of Elizabeth Mitchell and Gideon Adlon. There are still some other actresses who try to do what they can, but the youth of the cast does not allow for great dramatic efforts, nor does the lightness of the film truly demand it.But what really defeats this film is its plot: the film tries to recreate, in our time, the witch hunt fever that existed, occasionally, in some places in Christendom during the 15th to 17th centuries. This movement has more ancient roots: the Christian religion has always condemned the practices of witchcraft, and there are laws against witches in many ancient societies and civilizations, all the way back to the Roman Empire. The last woman to be officially executed for witchcraft in Europe was in 1782, and there are still modern countries, especially those with an Islamic religion, that formally condemn witchcraft in their penal codes.It just so happens that it just doesn't make any sense to try to recreate the witch hunt in a country like the USA, so openly democratic and defender of the individual freedoms of citizens. Even if we assume that magic exists and witchcraft is real (and there are many people today who believe this), it is inconceivable that a democratic country could ban magic or the practice of witchcraft, even for negative purposes. It's almost like forbidding someone to swear and curse: as wrong as it may be, it's a right that no one can take away from me, if I'm not offending anyone. I find it inconceivable that the US Congress would pass a constitutional amendment banning witchcraft, and that undermines everything the film tries to do afterwards. It just doesn't make sense.Summary: The problem with this film is in the plot: starting from a wrong premise, the whole plot ends up going wrong.",670429,FilipeManuelNeto,2.0,Negative
"Jim Broadbent and Helen Mirren are two performers I tend to follow and give any production they are in a try. This is yet another movie based on actual events. I have nothing against that obviously if it is well done, but as someone who writes novels I am sometimes tempted to ask if production companies could support screenwriters who write pure fiction a bit more often.But that observation takes nothing away from this production. Broadbent is good throughout, especially when he charms the jury in a courtroom scene, which is nearly worth watching the movie all by itself. Helen Mirren disappears into her role as the almost crumpled housewife and does a great job. The film held my interest and I didn’t see the slight twist in the plot coming, though it feels right once it is revealed.I will be willing to watch the movie again if the opportunity arises, which for me is what separates the adequate programming from the truly entertaining.",645689,narrator56,9.0,Positive
"I know that a lot of films require you to suspend reality and accept that what you are watching could happen. I'm fine with doing that IF the film at least tries to convince me with a story that has details which support the events it portrays. This film falls far short of even trying. I enjoy Mr. Freeman's work and gave this one a shot to see what it had in store. Not only does the film not work hard to convince me that the story is possible, the character played by Ms. Rose has such a lack of desire to really resolve her dilemma that it's almost comical. There are multiple violent scenes of people being shot and killed, a lot of time devoted to a motorcycle traveling in and around the city by Ms. Rose's character and the ""haunting"" portrayal of her daughter calling for her to help her - but it had nothing to do with the story !! The acting was not very convincing at all and left me sorry for watching the entire film just to see if it got any better later on. It didn't. Would not recommend this unless you have nothing better to do.",804435,Grimmbro66,4.0,Negative
"The Manor was...a good try....sorta. There is really nothing more that can be said about it as far as merit goes. I say that because it has what is needed for it to be a thriller, **IF** that thriller's suspense rating were fixed at a 2 instead of being able to utilize the full range 10 scale available. The movie had all the right ques for suspense, it just didn't have that ""edge of the seat"" guesswork, that ""grip your husband's bicep"" fear factor, nor the..._je ne sais quoi_ needed to make this movie engaging. The writers did a good job of showing how the MC's age and the problems she expresses to her family with what she is observing at the home, could be easily explained away as her having difficulty in adjusting; and how easily it is for the faculty to explain away the MC's fears. Whether it by fault of the writers or Hershey, the pacing of her character was a little off in that she's perfectly lucid for most of the movie, but in a meaningful scene of trying to convince her grandson what is happening, she is suddenly seems dementia-stricken...? It was too extreme and too sudden to be cosistent with the character's behavior up to that point. There was no outside influences to explain the change, such as lack of sleep, drugs, or abuse. The viewer is left thinking, ""What...!? What the hell is the matter with her?"" Instead of, ""Wow! They (the faculty) have really got her sounding crazy."" The writers failed in that regard. The creature in the movie was well designed too, and its scenes were on a good par for adding suspense, there just did not seem to be...enough. Enough terror, enough suspicion, enough suspension, enough doubt, enough of...""It"" needed to make this movie fit the genre. This movie is not _Angel Heart_. It's not _the Secret Window_. Hell, it's not even _the Number 23_. It's an...attempt. And under the current soft-serve snowflakey boundaries of political correctness, and social politics it successfully was a waste of time; B-grade. If I had to tell a friend about this movie, I would say, ""It looks new. And it has all the bells & whistles. You just can't hear any of them above a normal conversation...in a library.""MAJOR SPOILER(S) AHEAD:Okay. What is Hollywood doing? I mean really. What is to be learned at the end of this movie? What moral is trying to be conveyed here? That desires mean more than doing what is right?? That people's lives mean nothing; as long as they are on their on their way out the door of life that it's okay to use them for cannon fodder? Because if that is the case, then the writers did a very poor job indeed of trying to make the MC seem like the victim or prey in this movie, only to see her turn around and selfishly choose evil. The writing gave no indication that she was prone or would be prone to this behavior. You don't go an entire movie without a motivator, one way or the other, to indicate there's a chance this or that will happen. All this movie did was send the message that women are can be relied on to do the wrong thing when the end result is self-serving? (Okay, well that may be true.) BUT I don't think that was the goal here. --Back to the lessons perceived -- What's the next ""feel wrong"", that boys become needy man-children when left in women's care? (Well, okay. That may be true too.) But again, these are not lessons that should be the ultimate take away. So again: What is Hollywood doing or attempting to do??? This is not the only movie that leaves the viewing audience feeling awkward or cheated. I experienced this same feeling profoundly back when I saw _Law Abiding Citizen (2009)_. I didn't come out of that movie feeling as if the ""good guy"" won. And there have been a number of shows, both in streaming and cinema that have left me thinking, ""Why in the hell, did they even make this?!?"" Why is the moral comapss (if there is one anymore) in Hollywood so screwed up??? Barbera Hershey has been in Hollywood before it's common drug usage and synonymous reputation to Sodom & Gamora became common knowledge to movie-goers. She has starred in some movies that have become ""cult classics"", movies that have never seen the light of a televised award show, but are **_very_** well known to the generation the movie was shown; sometime beyond. _The Entity_ is one such a movie. I saw that movie 3 decades after it was made, and loved it. Had me wondering how they achieved some of the special effects of that time. Sadly, this movie will not be like that. $5 bin at the Walmart. It is definitely a ""One & Done.""

"_**Die Hard in the Woods: The Golden Years**_A woman on a hike in the remote hills of northern Georgia (Jaime King) witnesses something that brings in the authorities (Lala Kent, Tyler Jon Olson & Michael Sirow) and the help of a retired cop from up north (Bruce Willis).“Out of Death” (2021) is a sylvan crime thriller that only took nine days to shoot with Willis only working one day of filming, incredibly, which has drawn a feeding frenzy from armchair critics. Expecting the worst, I was amazed at what a decent flick can be made on such a short schedule and shoestring budget. It all comes down to the foundation of having a worthwhile story and a director & crew who know what they’re doing and how to efficiently pull it off, which Bill Lawrence (writer), Mike Burns (director) & team do.Sure, you could nitpick things like the CGI rain but, beyond such trivial qualms, it delivers the goods for this genre with quality themes and a dash of human interest. The flick effectively touches on things like grief/healing, avarice, political corruption & hypocrisy, injustice, nepotism, incompetence, survival, overcoming weaknesses, personal nobility, retirement, refreshing in the wilderness and the warmth of new relationships. It even throws in some sly amusement. Some complain about the music, but it’s an homage to “Deliverance” (1972) and well edited into the proceedings. Others nag about the supposedly lame title, but its meaning is obvious: Out of death something good can come. Willis’ character is understandably in the doldrums and suddenly finds himself thrust into a life-or-death situation where he rises to the challenge, which ironically pulls him out of the pit of melancholy and grief. It’s a similar scenario with Jaime’s character. Maybe I liked it more than others because I favor survival movies that take place in the woods, like “First Blood” (1982). While it’s not on that level, it should be enjoyed by viewers who appreciate modest-budget survival thrillers, such as “Nightmare at Bittercreek” (1988), “Transit” (2012), ""Rust Creek"" (2018), “Black Rock” (2012) and “Reclaim” (2014). Keep in mind that shooting in the forest ain’t easy to pull off.Honestly, “Out of Death” gave me increased respect for Bruce who, four months shy of 66 during filming, gave his best for a one-day shoot. The film runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Puerto Rico.GRADE: B",774714,Wuchak,7.0,Positive

"“Little Fish” is a heartbreaking, emotionally draining, end of days love story. The World is in the midst of a pandemic, but this neuroinflammatory affliction takes something more from people than just their lives, it destroys memory. Much like Alzheimer’s disease, if NIA is contracted  memories are erased, leaving the ones you love unaware of who you are or where they live.   “ Little Fish” Follows newlywed’s Jude ( Jack O’Connell ) and Emma ( Olivia Cooke ) along with their best friends Ben ( Raul Castillo ) and Samantha ( Soko ) as they are given devastating news. The microcosmic focus on the two couples is extremely effective. Well aware of World events unfolding around them, Plane crashes, car crashes, people going missing “Little Fish” just centres on the two couples as they battle to save their relationships as the pandemic takes its toll on both couples.As the narrative in “Little Fish” jumps timelines showing before and after NIA the deterioration in memory, particularly Jude, becomes emotionally devastating.

"Questions related to assisted suicide and the right to die have been debated hotly for decades, and proponents on each side of these issues have made passionate arguments for their causes. A number of fine films have addressed these issues, too, such as “Blackbird” (2018), “You Don’t Know Jack” (2010), “Whose Life Is It, Anyway?” (1981) and “The Barbarian Invasions” (2003). And now moviegoers can add the latest offering from writer-director François Ozon to that list. This fact-based drama about an elderly French stroke victim who asks his daughter to help him die examines the subject from a variety of angles, including the legal, medical, emotional and ethical considerations involved in carrying out such a highly charged act, and it does so with a great deal of integrity, authenticity and heartfelt feeling. It’s also one of the finest, most accessible offerings from a filmmaker whose works I believe often leave much to be desired. However, with that said, that’s not to say that this release is without its issues, such as several story threads that don’t feel fully resolved, as well as some occasionally strange camera work and seemingly superfluous narrative elements. Nonetheless, “Everything Went Fine” has much in its favor, including excellent performances by its three principals (Sophie Marceau, André Dussellier and Géraldine Pailhas), a comprehensive script, sustained pacing, well-placed moments of comic relief, and emotional impact without becoming manipulative or schmaltzy.

Unfortunately, once this ghost story gets into it's second act the movie devolves into a series of cliché's, poor plotting and heavy-handed monologues. The script is all text and zero subtext.

What’s going on? Written & directed by Michael Nader, “The Toll” (2020) is a technically well-made mystery/horror Indie that borrows the basic plot of “Wind Chill” (2007), yet isn’t as good or moving. If you like these kinds of flicks give it a try, but you’ll probably be disappointed. While the two main characters are interesting enough and there’s a sense of creepiness to the situation, not to mention the core mystery is intriguing (I don’t want to spoil anything), the increasing illusions were tedious to me.What really puts the nail in the coffin is a minor twist at the end that contradicts everything the viewer is led to believe about something up to that point (I’m being intentionally vague). “Wind Chill” had a minor twist as well, but it was organic to the story. This one just feels wholly contrived and you’re left feeling duped in an eye-rolling way. At least this was my experience.Nevertheless, I liked the filmmaking, the plot, the spooky sylvan ambiance and the cast.

"My god....this was horrible. Saw this on netchi--I mean Netflix. And this was just not my cup of tea as far as animations go. The movie is based off a video game that is pretty involved and cool to play if you have friends. And this might have been done in CGI or whatever format they are calling 3D films nowadays, but it had the quailty of a middle schooler's effort in writing a scripted story. I recommend seeing the real-time movie. That was not a work of art, but it was entertaining and held the attention. This animation should have been rated-E for everyone. I guess I'm just spoiled on japanese animation because Final Fantasy: Advent Children kept me on the edge of my seat, and had me hitting the rewind button so I could watch an entire action sequence again. **That** decidedly did NOT happen with this animation. This animation had me pausing the movie to see how much time was left before it ended. The voice acting is not abyssmal but it's definitely not worth what was paid to the actors. No one's voice seemed to match their character except for the black guy. lol Wait. I take that back. The old lady sounded like an old lady. As for the four other women in the animation, I strongly believe they all were voiced by one female. The pacing was horrible too. In some instances the film was shoving tons of info at the viewer, and in other instances you mentally tripped because the characters would say the names of creatures without any indication of what made the creatures a nuisance or imminent threat. I think it was supposed to show the production company had knowledge of the game's lore, but the delivery made the lines seem more like senseless filler since they did not contribute to the main story directly. This movie starts with a young guy who is not the most manly nor mature looking person, but is supposed to give off an air of a seasoned Hunter. He did not. He gave off no such air because he had zero facial hair. Not uncommon in this movie for some nefarious reason; NONE of the (I guess) young men had any facial hair. I don't know if that was a conscious decision by the company or if the programming simply didn't allow for the feature. I'm inclined to believe the former. Either way, the lack of facial hair made the men seem largely unmanly; like high schoolers who were playing dress up.Anywho, our ""seasoned Hunter"", Aiden, is telling a story and as he begins his tale the scene flashes back to a younger him. As mentioned before, with the lack of facial hair and his slender face, the time lapse could probably be assumed to be the year before or six months from the present. In actuality it was supposed to be years, but the guy's face had not broaden nor had gotten any hairier. He also kept the same stupid haircut from his ""youth."" So the audience must assume the flashback is years before. In short order, you see that Aiden is the town's unofficial self-proclaimed Hunter. Everyone knows him. He knows everyone; even the guy pouding his fur roof with a hammer. That's not a joke. The guy is repairing his straw/fur roof...with a hammer. [facepalm] You find out cats can cook, talk, walk on their two hindlegs, and steal things. You also assume Hunters don't grow facial hair, because Aiden meets an Ace Hunter and this clean shaven hero tells Aiden there is more to being a hunter than killing things, and that there is ""a Balance to all things living."" Let's skip ahead. There is trouble coming. An Elder Dragon is on the move. Migrating. And when it migrates it leaves a path of destruction from its unchecked elemental powers. And it's about to destroy Aiden's village. Aiden has pleaded with the Ace Hunter, Julius, he met on a hunting mishap to help save the town. The ace hunter calls for help, and OFCOURSE it's a female. One female hunter named Nadia, who carries gun the size of a Civil war cannon, but one she can carry around as if it weighed as much as a 9mm. Did I happen to mention she knows Julius personally? Because why not. The ""team"" fills in with Nox, the cat sentient who can steal, and another female hunter who is as peppy as she can be, Mae, who fights monsters in butterfly armor with wings that neither give her the ability to fly nor glide. Because that would be ridiculous. [facepalm] ...god, this movie was tiring. The dragon simply does not meet the hype of what Julius claims. In fact, the ""dragon"" turns out to be no bigger than (and very similar to) a common Aragami creature from the animation series _Godeater_. Not a lot of imagination there. The phrase, ""It's been done."" comes to mind.The main problem with this ""movie"" is that it was done poorly. It's a monster movie but there is no blood nor gore. It's supposed to be suspenseful, yet it comes across as muldane and very run-of-the-mill. It could have been so much more if the company could have made up it's mind as to what it wanted this movie to be and for WHOM it was made. On one hand no one gets injured, not even a bloody nose. But on the other hand, during the main fight with the Aragam--Elder dragon, characters can suddenly die!? It doesn't...gel. Not at all. The movie ends with a supposedly grandiose lesson about sacrifice and going on or some such. I don't know. I had started playing C.O.D at that point. My last opinion on this.

Terrible!!! The only way for you to like it is you’d have to be either intoxicated by alcohol or on drugs. It is the worst Christmas film I’ve ever come across and seen since Puppy Star Christmas due to being similar to the Home Alone franchise and a ripoff of it.,761548,kdumers,1.0,Negative
"Whilst I'd be inclined to view Hinterland as a work of fiction in most respects, it does capture the atmosphere of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire at the end of world war I and the subsequent transition of Austria into a proto-modernist state, beautifully. Hinterland is a well paced, surreal crime drama with Gothic overtones and a strong anti war message. Its superbly acted, with a cast of faces I'm familiar with from series such as Babylon Berlin. Perhaps the only downside is a dash of unnecessary and wholly anachronistic woke-ness, at one point but this can be overlooked, as this is in almost every other respect, a top quality production.10/10",843338,MovieGuys,10.0,Positive

"Ryan Phillippe sort of phoned it in didn't he? Which sucks, he's normally an OK actor but I guess he wasn't taking it seriously. Paycheck and all.Anyway, this is a family film made strictly for adults. If it wasn't for the drug use and language, it probably would have had a bigger audience. The adult content limited what would otherwise have been a great little G Comedy.Then again, the adult content is where they got the most laughs.It's not a great film, but it's not a woke film. It doesn't scream politics at the top of it's lungs and then rub your face in the mess it made.Instead it does its best to entertain, and because of that I'll give it 10 stars. I like movies that try to entertain me, I think we need more movies that just try to entertain.And because it tries to entertain, it's watchable.

"_**The good, the bad and the ugly of escaping the Res**_Abused Makwa grows up on a troubled Reservation in Wisconsin with his cousin Teddo in the 80s. Over three decades later they meet again and the contrast is glaring. Michael Greyeyes and Chaske Spencer head the cast while Jesse Eisenberg and Kate Bosworth have peripheral roles. ""Wild Indian"" (2021) is a slow burn drama about modern AmerIndians and the challenges of life on a Reservation, plus the ins & outs of life beyond. It has the melancholy, mundane tone of ""Leo"" (2002), ""The Woodsman"" (2004) and ""First Snow"" (2006). Although it may not be on the level of “Woodsman,” it’s arguably superior to the other two. Writer/director Lyle Mitchell Corbine Jr. grew up on Reservations in Wisconsin & Minnesota so the movie obviously depicts things that he witnessed. He respects the intelligence of the viewer without spelling things out. It’s a mixture of glaring clarity and vagueness that provokes you to reflect and put the pieces together.What’s going on with a certain character at the beach at the end? I’m part Abenaki and perfectly understand what was going on because I’ve done the same thing, but you don’t have to be any particular race/tribe to relate.The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in Oklahoma with bits done in SoCal.GRADE: B",656991,Wuchak,7.0,Positive
"The Ambush follows the standard ""patriotic"" war flick format.

I will add and this needs be said, the tragic situation that developed in Yemen, was provoked and furthered, by the West, who profited greatly from the war that developed in that nation. This contextual reality, needs to be understood. Those Yemenis fighting on the ground, might also be considered patriots for their own nations cause. In summary, well made but predictable patriotic fare, that's watchable but its clear bias, needs to be kept in mind.

"JUNIPER is a heart-warming comedy-drama about a self-destructive teenager (Sam) who is forced to take care of his feisty alcoholic grandmother (Ruth). Charlotte Rampling, an actor I have never really been impressed with, perfectly suits her role this time as Ruth. She's hilarious, foul-mouthed, and very lovable. George Ferrier is also excellent as Sam, Ruth's grandson, who slowly starts to change for the better as he spends more time with her. The relationship between Sam and Ruth is the heart of the movie, and it's wonderfully portrayed as it grows from one of resentment to one of love and respect.The movie is directed by Matthew J Saville, who also wrote the screenplay. This is his first feature film, and he does an excellent job. The movie is well-paced and never feels slow or dull. The dialogue is sharp and often very funny. I also enjoyed the soundtrack, which fits the movie perfectly. The cinematography is excellent, and the movie is very well-edited.Overall, I enjoyed Juniper immensely.

"A CIA operative tries to stop a deadly virus from killing millions of people, a fate I would welcome as opposed to watching this seventy-one minute monstrosity again. Agent Nash (Jason Toler) is recovering from brain damage sustained in Iraq. He is partnered with Mara (Sarah Brine), when the deadly chemical XZ-9 is stolen from a lab. There are a couple of turncoat agents in Nash's department, Winston (Chris Spinelli) and Dexter (Adam Weston Poell), who are after the stuff, plus crime boss Wan (Benny Tjandra)...I apologize, I had no idea what was happening throughout this film.Forget about the lack of budget and terrible performances for a moment. The screenplay makes no sense. I had no idea who characters were, what XZ-9 was (chemical? virus? laundry detergent?) although it is mentioned about a hundred times in the film, and after a hilarious opening sequence set in Iraq, I gave up trying. This is the kind of amateurish film where half the cast served in other roles behind the camera, but not in a noble or admirable manner. One minor character mispronounces ""emeritus,"" and the gaffe made it to the final cut. The story is intercut with stock footage of large cities to try and give this some epic scope, but sometimes the aspect ratio doesn't match, or the city footage is repeated in later shots. The sound quality is terrible, and even the subtitle generator I had running couldn't understand what some characters were saying, substituting the word ""(mumbles)"" instead. The action scenes are boring and comical, pay no attention to that kinda cool poster because none of that is in this movie, which features more footage of our hero sitting at a desk instead of standing or trying to save the world. I can appreciate making the most of your modest budget as much as the next person, but this is ridiculous, as if the film makers wanted to hurry up and finish this because of a deadline to get it onto Amazon Prime, which seems to specialize in terrible films like this. This isn't a poor man's James Bond ripoff, this is a poor man's poor man's ripoff of a poor man's James Bond ripoff.

"**By: Louisa Moore / www.ScreenZealots.com**When I was in college back in Washington, D.C., regional metal band GWAR was a really big deal on the concert circuit. I remember the first time I saw one of their shows, and the group I went with encouraged me to “wear something you would paint in.” It was great advice, as I left covered in a mixture of fake blood, imitation vomit, and an assortment of other manufactured bodily fluids that spewed from various orifices of the garishly costumed onstage performers. It was bloody disgusting, but also one of the most exhilarating concert experiences I’ve ever had.“This Is GWAR” is a lively documentary that explores the band’s origin story, history, and their plans for the future. It’s a story of misfit artists and their creativity, talent, and friendship that grew out of the punk scene of Richmond, Virginia in the 1980s. The story is so entertaining that you don’t need to have any knowledge of GWAR to find something to enjoy. Fans, of course, are going to appreciate the film on a higher level.Director Scott Barber crafts the story chronologically and isn’t afraid to tackle the tougher sides of GWAR’s history, from the revolving door of band members to the drug overdose of the band’s polarizing figurehead, Dave Brockie. The film celebrates Brockie’s genius and creativity that led to GWAR being born, and the documentary serves as a touching remembrance. But it also doesn’t shy away from his tendency to hog the spotlight, his bad behavior, and the rift he caused within the group. It’s this type of balanced storytelling that paints an overall, complete picture of the highs and lows over the years.Band members past and present are interviewed, and Barber lets them tell their own stories. It’s easy to like these guys, as they are all nerdy and charismatic with massive personalities. The interviews left me wanting more, and I felt like I was hanging out just shooting the breeze with my funny best friends. I got a little emotional hearing how much the band and friendships mean to the original members, not expecting the film to get so sentimental. Even better, Barber talks with celebrity “super fans” like Tom Lennon, Ethan Embry, and Weird Al Yankovic, each sharing what they love about GWAR.The film touches on GWAR’s most notorious history, like their music being banned after it was deemed to be “obscene filth,” their multiple arrests, and their fight to avoid censorship by their own record label. It explores the origin of the outrageous characters and costumes (like Beefcake the Mighty, Oderus Urungus, Flattus Maximus, and Slymenstra Hymen), and celebrates the band’s lowbrow, nasty style that fans absolutely adore. Despite all of this, the film reminds viewers that underneath these barbaric personas are ordinary looking guys with an extraordinary stage presence.GWAR isn’t a case of style over substance, although many either dismiss or forget that beyond the gimmick and outrageous shows lies a group of artists who are quite skilled. They are talented, dedicated performers and, as the film puts it, the joke is that they are actually good musicians. Will this documentary create a new army of fans? Probably not. But it certainly is fun to take a ride alongside one of the most shocking group of degenerates to ever hit the music scene.",833804,screenzealots,9.0,Positive

The story covering Deland McCullough and his mentor Sherman Smith is particularly noteworthy; not so much at first maybe, but stick around for the last act and there’s a serious ‘wow’ factor.Speaking of the climax, it’s driven home how many people, especially men, are walking around like the living dead, hampered by an invisible curse that weighs them down. The flick effectively informs about receiving the blessing of the heavenly Father and moving forward with faith, hope and love.Like me, it’ll probably prompt you to look back at your life and connect the pieces, answering questions, not to mention reignite the fire of motivation.The film runs 1 hour, 31 minutes.GRADE: B",858385,Wuchak,7.0,Positive

"What starts out as a cross between ""28 Days Later"" and a Jason Bourne movie, quickly turns into a stomach-churning chore to sit through, thanks to some atrocious camerawork. Dan (director Dan Rickard) washes up on a British beach with no memory of how he got there or where he came from. He is also ignorant of recent history, as a virus has decimated half the population, turning victims into bloodthirsty (running) zombies. Groups of people are immune, no one knows how the virus is spread, and Dan takes up with a houseful of angry young people who steal food during the day and hide indoors wiling the hours away. Group leader Sam (Chris Wandell) is onto Dan right away, as not only is the group hunted by the zombies, but suddenly military personnel are after Dan as well.Also known as ""Infected"" and ""Darkest Day,"" this movie could easily have fit into the ""28 Days Later""/""28 Weeks Later"" cinematic universe. The practical gore effects are very good, as is the makeup. The acting is hot and cold across the board, with Wandell coming off best as the hotheaded group leader. Unfortunately, most of this film is almost impossible to watch. The sound is terrible enough, but Rickard's constant shaking of his camera had me ill. Entire frames of film would blur out of focus. The editing makes ""Transformers"" look like ""Barry Lyndon,"" as I had no clue what was happening in half of the action scenes. It's shot so badly, I wasn't sure who lived in the safe house until some of them escaped to a camp, and a few were killed along the way. We are never given any clues as to Dan's real story and motives, so the big reveal about his identity is dead on arrival. I didn't care, I was trying to settle my stomach from screen time that looked like someone nailed a digital camera to a hardware store paint can shaker.

"""Irregular"" is Diogo Morgado's new film, a project of pure sweat and passion that will finally be available in cinemas on November 18. The film features performances by Pedro Teixeira, Maria Botelho Moniz, Carla Chambel, Júlia Belard and João de Carvalho, and represents a step in the right direction for the future of Portuguese cinema.The film tells the story of Gabriel, a very happy man. On his way to take his daughter for a trip, he stops at a gas station. Everything changes when he sees the child being forced into an unknown van that starts off at high speed. When he gets home, he realizes that his wife has also been taken away and that in her place is now another woman and a child he has never seen.The film begins, almost immediately, intense, because Diogo Morgado doesn't waste a moment throwing us into the middle of the action. From the first act on, a set of frenetic events unfolds that are supposed to make us tense. However, this initial unfolding is familiar, reminiscent of other international films that focus on unfortunate kidnappings.Morgado does an excellent job of presenting a set of twists and turns that are not only original, but impossible to predict. As it unfolds, we understand that the film is really something deeper, full of messages and willing to offer the Portuguese public, who are so eager for a change in their cinematic Horizon, an original story.None of the characters are random, and they all end up fitting into a web of dangerous misadventures. Pedro Teixeira, as the film progresses, surprises in a dramatic role that pulls the raw emotion of pain, giving what is probably the best performance of his career. He is, in fact, the one who stands out the most, trying to give the role the weight it deserves.""Irregular"" is by no means a perfect film, it contains some elements that are a little over the top and perhaps a little rushed. But this being a labor of love, a project where everyone gives 100% of themselves all the time and where creativity reigns high with a really challenging script, the film pushes Portuguese cinema into a bright future.I highly recommend watching this film, not only for its support of national cinema, but also for being an unpredictable and exciting film that will leave audiences on tenterhooks for Morgado's next project.7/10",662022,RSOliveira,7.0,Positive

"Having not known anything about Dashford Media aside from the fact that they aren’t a huge movie studio, I went into the theater expecting a level of quality much lower than I would normally expect while sitting in an AMC. I was extremely excited to learn that this was not at all true. _The Blacklight_ is an extremely well made film by a group of very creative and skilled people. The lighting of the film was what caught my eye mainly. There were some scenes in which the lighting was truly beautiful. One scene in particular is the one in which Danny is in a car and light from outside (I’m assuming an electronic billboard or a neon sign) continuously flashes a couple different colors, changing the entire color and vibe of the car. The feeling of this scene is just really cool. In addition the music in the movie was quite good. It always seemed well timed, and at the proper volume which is something many smaller productions struggle with. While a few of the parts seemed a little overacted, others went above and beyond. I thought Grant Lancaster did a terrific job as Danny and many of the closeups of Danny were shot in such a visually appealing way. Lancaster’s appearance fit the role of the protagonist in the story perfectly. The shining star of this production however is Richard Templeton as Lucky. Lucky is acted in a way that frightens the audience. He is a complete maniac that Templeton manages to capture to perfection. To wrap it all up, I think the writers hit the jackpot on the story. The story itself is so unique and interesting. The way that each character is different and unique creates excitement as the viewer tracks them and tries to predict what will happen next in the wild sequence of events in this film. I highly recommend seeing and supporting _The Blacklight_ in whatever way possible. I wish great things for the film as well as its cast and crew.",955950,Sorgannix17,8.0,Positive

"**_“Would you sit with me?”_**At a psychiatric hospital in middle America a no-name drifter (Colin Matty) is brought in by the police, covered in a white sheet because he was naked. While he is likable and his eccentric ways win over the patients, the faculty isn’t so sure (Afton Rentz, Griffin Cork, etc.), especially when a new boss takes over (Darrell Portz). “John, 316” (2020) is a mental hospital drama that’s naturally reminiscent of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” (1975), but with a supernatural element similar to “The Green Mile” (1999) and a protagonist who recalls Toni Collette of “The Sixth Sense” (1999). It’s amazing this only cost $75,000 (or $100,000 in Canadian dollars) because it’s a worthy drama with entertaining bits and potent insights. Sure, it’s not on the level of “Cuckoo’s Nest” or “Green Mile,” but I prefer it to “Sixth Sense” for several reasons. You get to know the characters and buy them as real people. Only Portz hams it up a bit, but it fits his antagonistic role.The spiritual points connected with me and they’re way more than just what relates to the title. I’m not going to give ’em away, yet they’re there for all to see; you just have to look beyond society’s programming (brainwashing). One simple scene could easily be missed it’s so mundane, but it speaks deep cosmic truth.The movie runs 1 hour, 43 minutes, and was shot in Alberta, Canada, at Alberta Beach & Edmonton (hospital). Alberta Beach is about 45 miles west of the big city.GRADE: B+/A-",912675,Wuchak,8.0,Positive
"I watched this short film at FEKK in 2022. It is a festival gem, amongst those works that you will rarely (unfortunately) find outside the close circuit of film cinephile. To bad, because Milano di Carta is a well-crafted destabilising cinematic journey within the billboard's paper. Recommended to the one seeking the other side of filmmaking; the extravagant, the unexpected, and the experimental. Needless to say, materiality and materialism are keywords for this work, which ultimately is presenting the audience with a new dimension, a hidden and melted landscape popping out of the sovra imposition of diverse images.",896814,Huib,8.0,Positive

">Very interesting and largely metaphysical work. A wonderful but also oppressive energy is felt, not only the panning and the subsequent -dramatization without people, or characters dramatizing-, but also, a kind of unknown restlessness to listen to in this very peculiar short film as an echo impregnated in the furniture and things, chairs and Carpet moments from the past, or from the alternative present of -what I understand- are key fragments of controversies or misunderstandings of life, I repeat, we ignore the spectators, perhaps only with the exception of Elsaesser or close relatives, such as couple or family dilemmas, because there is no sister or sister-in-law and the husband or brother, very much apart from the epistolary passage as enigmatic as it alludes to the director's grandmother. I love narrative exploration with such imponderable syntax. I've already seen it twice, I think Elsaesser should explore this sui generis vein more, I will continue to applaud these 'unique perspectives'.",862684,Aqueronte72,10.0,Positive

"From the opening shot, the esthetic of the loner invisible in the crowded environ of New York City who just wants to connect with someone sets the tone of our protagonist’s world. Gilbert, short, obese and not particularly attractive exists in a world dominated by several factors; his acute awareness of his lack of status, his obsession with his attractive abused neighbor- excellently portrayed by Dascha Polanco, the conflicted memories of his dynamic unsupportive deceased father and his controlling oppressive mother. He speaks to us as narrator of his own life and through his fixation with taking cellphone pictures of beautiful women rather than speaking to them.In a truly stunning performance writer/director Adrian Martinez embodies the moments of cultural failure and disconnection we all feel from time to time. But this is his day-to-day existence and something has to change. A chance observation of a street crime catapults him into a local hero and this is the opportunity to rise above his anonymous status. But life is more complicated than that. The film successfully performs the delicate balancing act of representing Gilbert as a hero, loner, creepy stalker and nice guy looking for love and acceptance. The film has many scenes where the viewer may simply want to turn away from the screen but can’t. The strong performances of Dascha Polanco (Orange is the New Black), Socorro Santiago as his tragically conflicted mom and Mozhan Marno as the city detective who sees him as a damaged man in a city of broken souls, round out a stellar cast.iGilbert is the first writing/direct feature effort of the immensely versatile Adrian Martinez. It is infused with a heavy doses of Hispanic cultural, true New York visuals and a sense of the phoenix rising from the flames. Every character has an easily digestible amount of daily pain and little avenue for successful expression or self-healing. That is the well written essence of the film. They are us and we empathize with them but thank God we are not them every day – hopefully.— Eric Cotten, Festival Programming Associate, MdFF 2021""There is beauty among the broken in writer/ director Adrian Martinez’s iGilbert, a dreamlike ode to human connection at a time in which our phones keep us safely cradled in our own bubble of safety….”  — Filmthreat.com “Adrian Martinez plays an isolated man looking for connection in a simultaneously classic and strikingly modern portrayal of the messy search for true connection”  — New Filmmakers Los Angeles “Incredibly creepy and sweetly endearing, all at once”— Ryan Fleck, director “Captain Marvel” “Mrs. America” “ ‘Marty’ for the digital age” — Annette Insdorf ""Great movie…  Really hit me emotionally.

" If you’re one of many fans of the cult classic ""Night of The Living Dead""(1968), then you may very well find yourself loving “Biological Loneliness” feature film documentary from director Karolis Jankus who immortalized and recorded the residents of Barcelona and Vilnius during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Biological Loneliness"" is about finding noises in silence, the abrupt end to ideology, and the heavy sense of an impending cataclysm that will destroy all civilization. The director abandons any attempt to show us a real pandemic, instead of people dying, and medics fighting for lives, he shows us the simple life and ordinary people still living, even when the entire world seems to have stopped still. The film opens with a shot of crawling ants, a busy social hub of life that calls back to our lives before the lockdown. We see naked prehistoric people riding an empty Barcelona subway. It is a juxtaposition of society continuing on even without the socio aspect of it. Life continues in silence. Are people talking to each other? Are they talking to us? The movie lacks cohesion, it does not welcome you with open arms, rather you have to force yourself into it, find glimpses of normality when there seems to be no normality left. A static composition, tilted shot, clumsy montage, lack of narrative coherence, flatly poetic sections involving urban landscape, machinery, and different noises – are chaotic qualities that give Jankus’ movie its strange, distinctive aura. We could ask the author why the movie uses a video camera instead of people's photos, but otherwise, we wouldn't know if they are still alive. Biological Loneliness is an undeniably strange movie, and sometimes it's hard to figure out what to make of it. The film is black-and-white and uses many contemporary art elements as black cubes and lines sometimes resembling prison bars. It's filled with irony and subtle humor but contains a serious message about the fragility and uncertainty of human existence. As an anthropologist, the cinematographer is amused by observing and studying all the people that swarm the cities. After all, it's just one day in the life of the capitals of Catalonia and Lithuania, which starts and ends without anything happening, and the movie ends, and the cities and people live on. Although I don't have all the answers, I recognize that this provocative, puzzling movie will stay with you long after the apocalyptic French music group’s Dazie Mae last chords go silent. In other words, if you like your arthouse a little less like Deconstructing Harry (1997) and a little more like the demented old movies of Jean Vigo or Luis Bunuel, then Biological Loneliness is an oddity worth experiencing. Its seriousness of composition makes the audience think of tragedy and its trick cuts and frame manipulation are closer to animation or advertisement than conventional film-making. Scenes of city life, sliced in half or doubled, superimposed or shot from stark, strange angles. Seeing ""Biological Loneliness” I was reminded of the film ""Season of the Witch""(2011) with Nicolas Cage and the wonderful Ron Perlman. I was reminded of the richness and detail of Europe in the early Middle Ages when the plague was reaping a deadly path through the land. I was reminded of marching crusaders and how the Devil was walking side by side with them. In Jankus’ eyes, the devil is less of an evil figure and more of a jester. He is confused, he is lost in the big city, but his radiant allure still shines through.",1159862,A.Ribera,10.0,Positive

"""It’s rare that I ever call out a film for breaching the trades description act but Kutte Fail is an exception that compels me to do so. Promoted as a horror-comedy, it lets itself down by not being scary in the slightest and not very funny, although this might be a case of humour getting lost in translation.But this doesn’t excuse the fact that the overstuffed climax leaves gaps in the logic you could drive a train through, which the script tries to paper over by having the cast ask what the hell is going on so we don’t have to. This being Aggarwal’s first film, one can see what he was going for, and had the script been streamlined, he might have pulled it off.

"Bud is a short film that was written and directed by Jack McLoughlin. One of the things that makes Bud work as such an effective short film is the apparent focus McLoughlin seems to have over his material. Writing a good and simple short film isn’t easy and it’s often one becomes over ambitious with it. Here, we have almost a perfect setup for a great short film that’s been diluted to its most minimalist element: just a man, having a conversation over the phone, in one location, in just a few minutes. And despite this time constraint we get a perfect and entirely satisfactory beginning, middle and end in just four minutes. Having a satisfying conclusion to your short film is extremely difficult, yet McLoughlin finds in this ambiguity the perfect conclusion for a viewer to walk away with a perfectly suitable ending.Full review at: https://afistfuloffilm.com/2021/03/09/bud-2021-an-emotionally-resonant-drama/",801587,YungDLean,9.0,Positive
