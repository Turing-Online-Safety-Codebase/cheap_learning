507403496,"` Samoa mo Samoa - Mata Usi Wikipedia Samoa (i/səˈmoʊ.ə/; Samoan: Sāmoa, IPA: [ˌsaːˈmoa]), officially the Independent State of Samoa (Samoan: Malo Sa'oloto Tuto'atasi o Sāmoa), formerly known as Western Samoa, is a country encompassing the western part of the Samoan Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Samoa announced their independence to Aotearoa - New Zealand in 1962. The main island of Samoa is Upolu, and is one of the largest islands in the Polynesian Triangle, next to Savai'i. The capital city, Apia, and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu. Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976.[6] The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, has been called “Navigators Islands” by late European explorers, who at 3000 years after Polynesia's ``Age of Navigation`` surged into an era of exploration. Before the 20th century because of the Samoans' seafaring skills, and origins of Polynesian culture, History Main article: History of Samoa Many recent studies into the pre-history of Samoa has been taken up by Asia Pacific Universities, including departments in Aotearoa - New Zealand. In general public education, the Polynesian Expansion is chronologically studied in the range of 3,000 years, leading off at a Lapita site at Mulifanua during the 1970s.[8] The origins of ``The Samoan Expansions`` are linked to the Pre-historical waves of Southeast Asian expansions which is a continued study in modern research in various scientific disciplines such as Genetics, Linguistics and Anthropology. Scientific research resides on the results that the Samoans originate from, or of, the ancient lines of Austronesian expansions and predecessors during some of the first waves expansions eastward across Southern Asia and Asia Pacific. The Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia through Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE is an on going Anthropological interest.[9] The Samoan origins are currently being thoroughly assessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards. It's theorized that intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained in Pre-historical eras between the Polynesian Lapita colonies. Archaeological record supports Samoan oral History and Genealogy that indicate inter-island exploration, war, colonization, and eras of Monarchal ties between ancient Samoans, Tongans, Fijians, and in Eastern Polynesia orders - Ali'i. Studio photo depicting preparation of the Samoa 'ava ceremony c. 1911. Interior of Samoan house, Apia, Urville 1842.At the final arrival of western exploration in the early 18th century. Jacob Roggeveen (1659–1729), a Dutchman, was the first documented to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by another western explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811), who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when missionaries and traders began seeking relations with Samoan orders. Religious missions were cautious in Samoa which began in the late 1830's by John Williams, of the London Missionary Society arriving in Sapapali'i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti.[10] According to Barbara A. West, another western author seeking interests of readers, ``The Samoans were also known to engage in “headhunting,” a practice invoked in ancient Samoan warfare, in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus taking his Mana.``[11] By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation of being savage and warlike from a famously published French journal of the times, which insued panic during that time, and a wonder of Samoan invasion. The violent altercations had occurred between a village of Samoa and a French expedition [La Perouse Expedition], who had lost almost the entire crew leaving the expedition adrift, over a French sailor direspecting a Samoan woman. Later expeditions by the British, German, and American forces, who by the late nineteenth century understood the invaluble oceanic position of Samoan trade, sought it's cooperation in resupply and refueling for coal-fired shipping and whaling. Wilhelm Solf, German governor of Samoa 1900-1910 Mata'afa Iosefo (1832-1912) paramount chief & rival for the kingship of SamoaThe Germans in particular began to show great academic and commercial interest in Samoa, especially on the island of 'Upolu where German firms established trade with Samoa in copra and cocoa bean processing; the United States rushed into the new Pacific international trade and formed alliances with Samoan orders, be it the Chiefs, High Chiefs of the public, or with the current anointed Monarch. Most intuitively, the American government established their strongest relations on the islands of legend, Tutuila and Manu'a, (which later became a protectorate of the USA as American Samoa). At one point during Samoan civil unrest [a conflict between the Samoan Orders], Britain sent troops to protect already attempted enterprise, harbour rights, and the consulate office. The political unrest, already in motion even before western trade was established, set off the eight-year civil war, where each of the three western powers supplied Samoan campaigns with arms, ammunition, and in some cases, regiments or combat troops to the Samoan campaigns. A western title of the events, titled the Samoan crisis has recently appeared, describing the critical juncture in March 1889 when all three western allied contenders sent troops, supply, and a number of decorated warships into Apia harbour, for the largest Pacific-scale war seemed imminent. The war seemed set, until a massive storm [Tsunami] on 15 March 1889 damaged permanantly or destroyed all the fleets, warships, and troops, ending the western military conflicts.[12] The Second Samoan Civil War was a conflict that reached a head in 1898 when allied Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States were locked in dispute again with Samoan campaigns. The Samoan Siege of Apia occurred during the Second Samoan Civil War in March 1899 at Apia. Samoan Loyalist forces to Prince Tanu were besieged by a larger force of Samoan Loyalists to the reknown Mata'afa Iosefo. Allied to the Samoan Prince Tanu were sent troops from four British and American warships. Over the course of several days in battle, one side of the Samoan insurgents were defeated.[13] Allied American and British warships shelled Apia on 15 March 1899; including the allied USS Philadelphia. Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States quickly wished to resolve the campaigns, which were costing far more than trade profits, and what seemed may last to an unknown date. The partitioning with Samoa was convened on at the Tripartite Convention of 1899.[14] 20th centuryThe Tripartite Convention of 1899 agreed that in the Samoan Islands, two parts:[14] the eastern island group would become a protectorate of the United States (the Tutuila Islands in 1900 and officially Manu'a in 1904) and is today known as American Samoa; the western islands, by far the greater landmass, became known in western networks as German Samoa [German Allied with Samoan Orders] after Britain retreated all enterprise with Samoa, Britain then in retaliation to Samoan and German alliances, sought termination of German allied rights in the Kingdom of Tonga, and certain areas in the Solomon Islands and West Africa.[15] By 1912 the German administration had achieved a set stage for long-term relations with Western Samoa, understanding the traditional forces in Samoan politics. This maintaining of relations was formed with local participation in a newly forming Samoan government. Samoa kept their Tupu (King), nor even alii sili (similar to a governor), with two Fautua (Advisors) added or appointed. Tumua and Pule (traditional governments of Upolu and Savaii) were for a time separate, one type of government for Samoan traditionals, and another for newly made foreign trade; all decisions on matters affecting western interests and titles were through Samoan Orders and the Governor. To complete the process with new foreign trade, a new Fa’alupega was created. The Fa’alupega is a formal greeting which acknowledges those being greeted and their status. The Fa’alupega, which had been nationally accepted on both Samoan island chains; The Fa'alupega is as follows: ``Tulouna a Tumua ma Pule, Tulouna a Itu’au ma Alataua, Tulouna a Aiga-i-le-Tai, Ma le Va’a-o-Fonoti, Tulouna a Tama ma a latou aiga Po’o aiga ma a latou tama``. This firstly recognized the authority and identity of principal districts of Samoa through their spokesmen – Tumua ma Pule, Itu’au ma Alataua, Aiga-i-le-Tai, and the Va'a-o-Fonoti – and the highest titles which were bestowed by these Samoan Orders. It concludes with the recognition of the great maximal descent groups of Samoa and their “sons” who had been chosen to hold the highest titles. The new Fa’alupega of for German allied in Samoa, which in its first line, recognises the Kaiser (Kaisa), and apparently announces Great Malietoa Tanunafili [King} and Tupua Tamasese to be supervising advisors to the governing council for Germans in Samoa. ``Tulouna a lana Maiesitete le Kaisa o le tupu mamalu o lo tatou malo kasialika aoao.

However, a force need not be ``perceived`` to exist. The definition of ``acceleration`` is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead. #Provide definition: ``momentum (quantity of motion)`` #:Hmm, this isn't exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is, in fact, both mass and motion. Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I'm afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more. #Following the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a ``force`` are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the ``force`` of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. #:There is a slight issue here with the sentence: ``Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a ``force`` are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions.`` This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a ``force`` associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.

Ethan Allen: Frontier Rebel. Syracuse University Press. ISBN 0-8156-2141-8. Jellison writes well about Allen and the grants dispute without the fawning Vermont bias your links present. :*Van de Water, Frederic. The Reluctant Republic, New York: John Day, 1941. Van de Water is also not ridiculously biased, even though he's a Vermont historian. :You ask ``what law?`` was against the granters? Pretty much all of the law except that of their own making was against them. The land they bought was improperly granted by Benning Wentworth, the governor of New Hampshire. Some of the grants were made even after he agreed to stop doing so (for example, those purchased by Ethan Allen in the 1770s were made after King George III ruled against Wentworth and declared the territory to be New York's). New York uncharitably refused to recognize Wentworth's grants without paying additional fees to New York; money most of the grantees did not have. This is what started the resistance. :The resistance was complicated by the fact that there were grantees who wanted New York rule; this complication was especially problematic in the greater Brattleboro area. In my opinion, this dispute had precious little to do with the Crown, and lots to do with inter-colonial territorial rivalries, complicated by interpersonal rivalries. When you claim things like ``the crown was trying to steal their land``, it's like someone whose car title has been declared invalid by a judge complaining that the President of the United States is trying to steal his car. This is silly. :Just because William French ``represents the common folk`` doesn't mean he gets to have a whole Wikipedia article written about him. He needs to meet Wikipedia's definition of notability for people for that (see specifically WP:1E, covering people known for a single event). The event is notable (in my opinion I knew of it from working on Ethan Allen), but the person is not. I suggest you try your hand at writing Westminster massacre. '''' `",False,dev

Remember that *any controversial unsourced material* will be challenged and removed as per WP:Verifiability. Now, that everyone knows that, we can hopefully start a sensible and reasonable discussion on Seoul again. I will start with pointing out some very basic mistakes here: *The reference everyone seems to quote has no mention of this invented system called ``Seoul Subway Line 1-9``. Strictly speaking, it lists lines owned by Seoul City's government. *That reference also says that Line 7 extension to Incheon is to open by late 2012, which it did. Since it is outdated, the true number is 327km. *Gyeongchun has no grade crossings (Terra is still remembering the now passed away Gyeongchun line from the 80s) and will never have KTX service (which he is again confusing with Wongju-Ganneung Line, a separate line under construction exclusively for HSR) *Gyeongbu Line for the metro service of Line 1 operate on a separate track, hence no track sharing. *Gyeongin - Are you kidding me? Freight and intercity trains? Where is that nonsense coming from? This is an exclusive metro line with no other traffic whatsoever. This line is metro exclusive. How old are you? I mean like you seem to remember Seoul from the 80s or something. Now, I have addressed the issues above assuming that track sharing is not allowed, which is an invented original research as raised by BsBsBs. Looking back at the sources..neither APTA nor USDT make any mention of that. The 2011 UITP source does mention something similar to it in a footnote saying that ``networks that are functionally separate from the rest of the rail system`` are basically metros from what I understand. Now remember they say ``functionally`` - not ``track sharing``. That's because the Korean government's legal law defines Line 1's Gyeongbu section for example, as a metro because it has a dedicated track on its own that follow the same path as the intercity trains next to it. In other words, it is functionally separate from the rest of the railway system and hence meets UITP's definition, which is very Eurocentric by the way. Seoul Metro and SMRT are members of UITP, so clearly track sharing is absent from their definitions. But functionally separate is present. And this is exactly how things should be done. And this 10 minute rule is completely absent anywhere in UITP/APTA or USDT and was voted out by consensus by multiple users (except IJBall). Legally, Incheon Subway is part of the metro system, so there's no doubt in including that as I have mentioned before with the legal sources. From what I know, Korail will be completely updating their website on April 1st, with the new updated data for their subways. So we will have direct numbers for all of Korail's metros pretty soon. The issue of sorting metros by systems and not by operators, is something that is not agreed with here. It would require a name change on this article. This will need external consensus and is something we will deal at a later time. `",False,dev

I respect your role to determine that the data is valid and the references are correct for Wikipedia. Re: Norumbega. See the Lok map. Norumbega is clearly marked on this map of 1582 by Michael Lok in the location of modern New England. The Lok map has the names of J. Cabot, 1497 and Jac. Cartier,1535. The rivers and terrain features around Norumbega are similar to the New England terrain today. Richard Hakluyt b knew what was on the map when he included the map in ``Divers Voyages touching the Discoveries of America, London, 1582.`` A similar, but better, drawing of Norumbega was made in Rome on a map by Bolognini Zalterij in 1595. 0n both maps Norumbega is as prominent as Canada. I.e. if Canada existed, then so did Norumbega. On neither map is there an attempt to connect Norumbega to Vikings. So the words, ``Inextricably connected with attempts to demonstrate Viking incursions in New England.`` are misleading. They imply that the name ``Norumbega was found by scholars who attempted, but did not succeed, to connect Norumbega to Vikings. Norumbege was a correctly named location in America before AD 1600 without any indication of Vikings. Today modern scholars have repeatedly demonstrated close valid connections between Norumbega and Vikings in New England: The French called the people in Norumbega, ``Nauset.`` Coulter, Tony, 1993 Jacques Cartier, Samuel de Champlain, and the Explorers of Canada, Chelsea House Pub. NY. [URL] [If the French silent ``t`` is not voiced, the word ``Nauset`` sounds like ``Norse.``] The Nauset spoke/speak Old Norse Sherwin, Reider T., 1940 -56 The Viking and the Red Man, Vols, 1-2 Funk & Wagnalls, NY, 3-8 private printing Stromsted, Astri A. 1973 Ancient Pioneers, Early Connections. Many New England place names are Old Norse, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, Narragansett, and Wampanoag, Douglas-Lithgow, R.A. 1909/2001 Native American Place Names of Massachusetts, Applewood Books, Bedford, MA See Sherwin The Nauset origin stories included ancient migration from Iceland 1994 Medicine, Manitonquat, The Children of the Morning Light, Macmillian Publishing Co. and The Nauset had/have Norse DNA. See Gene Park in [URL] The evidence indicates Norumbega was an established Norse settlement in America in 1497. The most knowledgeable scholars of America in 1497 knew that Norumbega was located in what would become New England. Those scholars did not know that the name was associated with Norse. The names Norumbega and Nauset are not found on English maps after John Smith's voyage in 1614. Modern multiple attempts to verify that Norumbega was, in fact, a Norse territory have repeatedly produced valid results, which have been ignored by the social scientists. Ignoring a name and results DO NOT make the name legendary. There is a reason a name is ignored, i.e. maybe to cover up and erase the knowledge that the Norse were in America since 1497 at least. Then the 17th century English accepted the Columbus was first myth to deny Norse presence in North America. The issues were the Doctrine of Discovery and the English Charters, which stipulated that the English could not settle where there were Christians already, settled. Any hint that Nauset were in Norumbega was a serious concern for the Puritans. I think Norumbega should read: Norumbega (orNorumbègue,Nurumbega, etc.) was a place name for modern New England on the world's maps for 119 years. (AD 1497 - 1616). In 1616 Robert Clerke drew Captain John Smith's Voyage to Norumbega and beyond. [URL] Clerke omitted both Canada and Norumbega from the map. Norumbega never appeared on an English map again. French maps of a century later still show Norumbega near New England. [URL] The French found Nauset (pronounced ``Nause``) in Norumbega. The Nauset spoke a dialect of Old Norse. Many place names in Norumbega are Old Norse. DNA studies show that on the northern route into the United States, the Norse people mixed with [American] peoples.

Geoffrey of Monmouth used Britannia major and Britannia minor to refer to the island of Britain and Brittany respectively. Which name fell into abeyance - Great Britain?

113285721,"In advance, I should state that I'm not qualified to give a definitive answer on the COP issue. That said, there are (in principle) two efficiency issues: the first is the efficiency of a given engine/technology (the heat pump), and the second the efficiency of a given system/installation (the parallel for, say, cars may be identical engines using different gearing ratios or even tires). In principle, air conditioners and geothermal heat pumps use the same technology, so the efficiency there should/could be identical (in terms of work per unit of energy). Geothermal pumps get their installed efficiency advantage (compared to air source heat pumps, i.e. air conditioners) primarily from the fact that they are dumping the heat to a naturally cooler heat sink. Or to put it a slightly different way: an air conditioning system will be more efficient at an ambient air temperature of 70 degrees fahrenheit (to cool to, say, 65 degrees) than it will be at 110 degrees. Since the ground temperature might be 40-50 degrees, the ground source heat exchange system will cool more efficiently - dumping the heat is less costly (and compressing a cold gas takes less energy than compressing a hot gas). It can also work in a larger temperature range: any heat pump will have a temperature beyond which it won't work well (possibly at all?) - as the ambient temperature gets higher, less cooling is possible. I think there is actually a technical limit, but this needs to be confirmed: if the exchange medium (cooling fluid) expands at a heat level that is equal to or lower than the ambient temperature, heat exchange may stop being possible or practical.",False,dev

649874504,"Annotated Bibliography for the Iron Butterfly [URL] This source gives an overview of the Iron Butterfly option strategy. It goes in depth into various factors an investor might want to consider when creating a strategy. These factors include: motivation, variations, max loss, max gain, volatility, time decay, and risk. There is also a picture of the strategy’s payoff graph. [URL] This source also gives an overview of the strategy. It goes more into detail of how the strategy is used and its purpose in a portfolio. There is also an example that it included which it helpful in picturing how the strategy is formed. It also includes advantages as well as disadvantages that it has to offer. Example: ABC Company is trading at $50 in August. Eric wants to use an iron butterfly to profit on this stock. He writes both a September 50 call and put and receives $4.00 of premium for each contract. He also buys a September 60 call and September 40 put for $0.75 each. The net result is an immediate $650 credit after the price paid for the long positions is subtracted from the premium received for the short ones ($800-$150). Premium received for short call and put = $4.00 x 2 x 100 shares = $800 Premium paid for long call and put = $0.75 x 2 x 100 shares = $150 $800 - $150 = $650 initial net premium credit [URL] This source talks about the reverse iron butterfly strategy. It describes what it is and when an investor should employ the strategy instead of the original iron butterfly. It says how to create the strategy and gives key points about the strategy. The source also gives the strategy’s potential profit and loss scope. [URL] Similar to the other sources, but goes into more detail in some areas. It adds a market forecast into the mix. It says that a forecast of the market needs to be done in order to execute the strategy effectively. There is also discussion of the strategy included, which says the impact of the strategy and what people use it for. The impacts mentioned are: stock price change, change in volatility, and time. There is some interesting controversy on the nature of the name having long in the beginning because of the net credit that is being taken on. [URL] This is an article that discusses how a hedge fund may use an option. It is used as a way to hedge against some of the risk in a portfolio. Because of its four positions in both long and short options contracts, there is a market neutral output. Unintentional risk exposure is decreased when using the strategy. The article also talks about an interesting 1-2-3 iron butterfly. This may be an interesting point to talk about with further research. [URL] This article takes on an opposing view to options trading. It makes the argument that when looking at the statistics of stock return risk, there are some basic intuitions that are left out. Specifically if you are selling options, there should be a 68% chance that the stock will stay within one standard deviation and therefore you will make money. This doesn’t seem to be the case because of time decay and the expiration of the option. Therefore the chance that the price will not move i",False,dev
615942519,"`Harassment As I read the Wikipedia guidelines, Harassment is regarded as far worse than any perceived COI. To quote ``to make the target feel threatened or intimidated, and the outcome may be to make editing Wikipedia unpleasant for the target, to undermine them, to frighten them, or to discourage them from editing entirely.`` - which is exactly how I feel. COI This is my statement When I first took an interest in Wikipedia I scratched my head for subjects to take on. During the process of Googling old friends and acquaintance - as everyone does - I discovered that an old friend Greg Day was now running a PR company and I looked up one or two of his clients. Seeing that one or two - Kevin Howarth, Simon Rumley, were not mentioned on Wikipedia I thought that I would have a go at tackling them. I could have contributed to many other pages - and have - but I wanted to be the initiator of a page that no one had tackled before. Not long afterwards Greg Day got in touch and mentioned that he had seen the pages. He said ``how would I like to be an associate of the company`` and - being a journalist and always looking for extra bits on the CV - I said why not. I then went on and edited Alan Jones and Hayley-Marie Axe, never thinking that any conflict of interest was involved. I still do not think that any COI was involved since a) I was never paid to do it b) I was never requested to do it c) I was trying to make a statement and not advocating or promoting anyone's career d) Writing and researching Wikipedia is just a hobby, end of. If that is so then you may as well say there is a COI over my edits of the Bolingbrokes and the Somervilles to whom my connections are no less nor more than the Howarths and the Rumleys - random topics of interest. That does not constitute a COI. Liquid Nitrogen I am sorry, but I do not see your point in removing my edit. — Preceding unsigned comment added by • COI whatever you think best. I wouldn't mind, but this ``policy`` seems to be applied in a random fashion and would only be fair if it was applied universally. Are you seriously expecting me to believe that the editors who originate pages about commercial product don't have some vested interests and/or COI. One would have to suspend disbelief to take that line. I have read not one but dozens of articles that do a wonderful job of promoting commercial interests. I guess it's one law for the independent editors and another for the corporations. Thus was it always. Rather than picking on people like me and making mountains out of molehills it would serve Wikipedia better to weed out the real abuses by cynical commercial interests rather than the perceived ones. Anyway, I do not own the pages discussed, so people can do whatever they like. I'm sure Jimmy wales never intended Wikipedia to become such a bear pit! Stange Behaviour By Editor McGeddon I am not sure how such a simple process of factually updating a wiki page has turned into what i can only describe as a strange obsession by a person calling themselves McGeddon. I have no idea what this persistent person who i can only describe as an INTERNET TROLL's motives are. I have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with factual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting South Africa. If that is a crime then i apologise but the fact is i have no connection to the artist apart from the country i live in and the love of art. In response to the Thandi Zambo and Thandi Moyo, they are both me, I couldn't remember my password for Zambo, which is my maiden name, so i made Moyo, which is my married name. This strange person McGeddon, who obviously is a very empty person with nothing in his life is harassing me and vandalising all my hard work. I see he does this to everyone, it's probably because he has no power in the real world. Anyway i am moving on from this project and i will have to change my username when i look at other south african artists to update their pages to save myself from harassment from this TROLL. I admit i am not an expert at editing wiki pages but instead of assistance from this McGeddon he choose the vindictive route flexing his technical knowledge. He must hide behind his computer and live out his useless existence. Regards Thandi Moyo (nee Zambo) — Preceding unsigned comment added by • Clout I am more than happy for that to be done; as I've said before I have no vested interest and feel that I have run foul of the catch-all COI regulations which don't seem to allow for commonsense. I have got so many other things to do and when editing Wikipedia stops being a pleasure then all I can say is that it's a sad day indeed. So I won't be doing anything apart from maybe looking at my Walter and Jane Somerville pages, one of which has already attracted attention. To say that one of the world's leading cardiologists is not notable is crassly ignorant and extremely insulting. Liquid Nitrogen I mean in classrooms when students learn about liquid nitrogen. — Preceding unsigned comment added by • Liquid Nitrogen Hmm...I see.

My own experience is, of course, anecdotal. But the results were little short of astonishing.

My concern is that pro-free speech is represented by only republicans while anti-free speech is represented by only democrats. This makes democrats look extremely intolerant. Ultra-liberal author, professor and activist, Camille Paglia (who has her own Wiki page) said during a radio interview “I speak with authority here, because I was openly gay before the ‘Stonewall rebellion,’ when it cost you something to be so. And I personally feel as a libertarian that people have the right to free thought and free speech,” She continued, “In a democratic country, people have the right to be homophobic as well as they have the right to support homosexuality — as I one hundred percent do. If people are basing their views against gays on the Bible, again they have a right of religious freedom there,” Paglia went on to point out that while she is an atheist she respects religion and has been frustrated by the intolerance of gay activists. “I think that this intolerance by gay activists toward the full spectrum of human beliefs is a sign of immaturity, juvenility,” Paglia said. “This is not the mark of a true intellectual life. This is why there is no cultural life now in the U.S. Why nothing is of interest coming from the major media in terms of cultural criticism. Why the graduates of the Ivy League with their A, A, A+ grades are complete cultural illiterates, etc. is because they are not being educated in any way to give respect to opposing view points.” “There is a dialogue going on human civilization, for heaven sakes. It’s not just this monologue coming from fanatics who have displaced the religious beliefs of their parents into a political movement,” she added. “And that is what happened to feminism, and that is what happened to gay activism, a fanaticism.” And the way the article is written on Wiki is exactly what's being highlighted in the controversy section. There are republicans that denounced the comments made by Phil and there are democrats that support his right to free speech... yet only republicans are listed in support and only democrats are listed in opposition.

A stroke is the loss of activity of a discreet brain area (lesion) because of blockage of the blood supply to that brain region. Vascular diseases are associated with a higher prevalence of Parkinson's Disease [1]. There are three different pathologic states that produce Vascular Parkinsonism (VP), including multiple lacunar infarctions in the basal ganglia area [2,3], subcortical arteriosclerotic changes (Binswanger's disease) [2,3] and a single vascular lesion that present a clinical picture indistinguishable from Parkinson's disease [2,3,4]. Parkinson's Disease symptoms occur in Vascular Parkinsonism [5-12]. However, resting tremor is either reduced [5,6], or absent [7,8].

4763903,"` I disagree with the hard-and-fast division into ``English`` and ``non-English`` in the Billion and Trillion (which is too definite IMO) articles, (but agree the accepted Wikipedia value should be the US one). Here is why. My Collins English-German dictionary, third edition, purchased in England 1997, has this entry: Trillion n (Brit) Trillion f; (US) Billion f. Now the Trillion referred to is the German for 1 followed by 18 zeroes, and Billion is the German word for 1 followed by 12 zeroes. My few German acquaintances tell me they know this difference between the British and American (US) usage of ``Trillion``. Similarly for Billion. Also I did once hear an English-speaking person use ``milliard``, I had to ask them what it was! They (a well educated but non-British person) thought it was a common English word. My Cassell's English-Italian dictionary, admittedly an old 1985 edition, makes the same distinction in this way: Billion Bilione (English, 1,000,000,000,000; Amer. 1,000,000,000) Similar distinction for Trillion. Neither divides the usage into ``English`` and ``non-English``, speaking or otherwise. Admittedly current usage in the United Kingdom is either confusion or has adopted the American (US) usage. This has certainly been the case in the financial industry. I was taught the 'old' British usage of both terms in a school run by Americans in a British colony (helps to pass the British exams). The www.unc.edu link in Talk:Trillion above explains this, so I feel the articles should reflect this admittedly ambiguous difference. I tend to clarify when speaking English to well-educated non-British Europeans (who are aware of the problem with Billion and Trillion), as to exactly which I am using (``American`` or ``British``) to make it clear. Having said all that I'm not sure what's best: American and non-American; English and non-English; British and American (how the dictionaries usually give it); standard usage and non-standard? - | 11:06, 2004 Jul 21 (UTC)`",False,dev

Siam was not a single distinct political entity, but rather a name used by foreign, mostly western, contemporaries to refer to the Thai nation since the Ayutthaya Kingdom up until the change of the name to Thailand. (Sukhothai was regarded as distinct from Siam, which at the time referred to Ayutthaya, according to Chris Baker and Pasuk Phongpaichit's A History of Thailand.) What is this? This the worst article on the english wikipedia concerning Thailand, it needs to be deleted. All the facts are already in other articles and there is absolutely no need for this article's existence at all. It should be deleted as soon as possible. As a Thai the name 'Siam Empire' itself is ridiculous no such nation state ever existed. The people in the area and the land itself is called Siamese and Siam respectively, in turn they were ruled by various centers of power which ever one is more dominant militarily at the time- but never a concept of a single state, only of successive states which copy the traditions of others before it. In Thai itself no self respecting historians would describe the various 'Krungs' (e.g. Krung Sukhothai, Krung Si Ayutthaya, Krung Thonburi, Krung Rattanakosin) as an 'Empire' only as 'Kingdoms'. Please delete this article as soon as possible it is completely historically incorrect and unnecessary. :But I think it is worth to describe what the word ``Siam`` is as they have its own articles in many languages including Thai.

And I asked for another side of the story, and questioned how big of a deal this was to put in the introduction. Your response here is confusing. As far as ``citing my sources``, I am questioning your views and whether they belong in the article, not making additions to the article. Several of your quotes are very weak examples... many countries could claim anti-Americanism on the basis of involvement in the Middle-East... that doesn't mean it's a relevant enough addition to put into the INTRODUCTION of an article on one of the most trafficked websites in the world, that is meant to specifically talk about the MAJOR issues between two specific countries.

I don't see why you get to just dub a source ``reliable``, when I thoroughly explained why I determined it ``unreliable`` (or, rather, inappropriate to add). I read that source, left you detailed comments, and you said something like ``Don't POV push`` and reverted my edits. You are not making an argument here. (re: Culture Clash in Archive 2) Again, there are two sides to every story. Please try to tell both if you are going to edit this article. Many Canadians would laugh at the idea that the USA causes a ``profound fear`` that their sovereignty will be overwhelmed (and why do students' opinions have so much weight, by the way?). But there likely won't be many sources to support this, because the initial premise that it even might be the case is so rare that such sources wouldn't exist for a counter argument. Nevertheless, I'll take a look... One last time... this is about obscurity clouding neutrality, and onesideness breaching neutrality. I am not trying to say that what you're saying is not true at all. I'm sure it is true the the extent that it is. But how much is that?

I guess there is no system of checking the edits of such editors against vandalisation such that they can blatantly claim that whatever you report to authorities nobody is going to listen. This is not according to Wikipedia standards and also not healthy with respect to protection of articles on Wikipedia. *Protection should be such that deletion and blanking should not be allowed to editors other than the author of the article or administrators. This would curtail vandalism to a great extend. It will also stop vulturism in editing wherein editors who do not contribute with any articles but just pick on other editor's articles for whatever reasons would be discouraged and genuine critics would be encouraged who will follow the procedure of mentioning on talk pages for editing. *Furthermore if there are issues it can be discussed in talk pages and updation made accordingly. *If any author does not log in for specific period of time the article may be alloted to another editor or taken up by adminstrator or it can be locked and put up as library content which can be edited by any administrator. *This would add international standards as one expects on Wikipedia and also encourge authors to provide more contribution.

59917790,"` Answer to Mütze Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!! Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page: ``Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article.``. As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia. Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly! Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens. And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze. So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far. But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia! Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page: ``Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers.``. If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles! So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia! Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively! So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody. MichaelIsGreat`",False,dev

169008691,"::Army1987: I started the subject here because 1) the Kilogram article was seriously deficient when I first started on it (here’s what it looked like), 2) there has long been the common misperception that the kilogram is uniquely a unit of mass and the pound is a unit of weight, so people would logically first begin their research into the issue at Kilogram, and 3) the nuances of the effect of buoyancy on mass standards and precision metrology seem to be appropriately addressed in a Kilogram article too. It has previously been suggested that a new article be created called “Mass versus weight”. Indeed, we can create such an article but it’s not the sort of article title that one would think of typing directly to look up. So you end up just briefly touching upon the subject in “Kilogram” and providing a link to the “Mass versus weight” article. I like Wikipedia’s ability to link to other articles for further reading. When done judiciously, you really exploit the strength of hyperlinks; when done to excess (like linking dates to see what the hell other totally unreleated events occurred on July 17, 1763), it burdens the article IMO. When linked properly, we write for instance, “While the weight of objects are often expressed in kilograms…” and the Weight article is one that one would type all by itself and linking to it provides a logical, handy, easy-to-remember article for further reading. But an article titled “Mass versus weight” strikes me as simply fragmenting a subject for the sake of fragmenting a subject. Few would remember two weeks later that the topic is titled “Mass versus weight” but would remember that you first go to “Kilogram” to find the link. That’s the clue that an article shouldn’t be fragmented into a separate topic: how obvious is the title of the article? Wikipedia is getting out of hand in this regard IMO. That’s my 2¢ anyway.

Can we now constructively return to the matter in hand? After all, it is the task of all of us Wikipedians to see to it that articles contained in this Free Encyclopedia adhere to encyclopedical standards and not those of the yellow press, isn't it? 'Free' should not stand for 'free of correct facts', 'free of truth(fulness)' or for that matter 'free of ethical restraints'. One would think we all, at least those of good will among us, agree on that. Now it happens to be the case, if not by willful disruptive tendentious editing then by negligence, that in its current state the article Francesco Carotta is full of errors of all sorts and easily verifiably so, some of which were mentioned in the previous, now ``deleted`` comment. Especially the section on the ``Dutch media controversy`` is a complete distortion of the real events, for instance, the review of Peter Veldhuisen was not related at all to the activities and pronouncements of van Hooff. This section needs a thorough revision, or maybe the best thing to do would be to just delete it, since it does not provide any information on the theory and might be of interest only to the yellow press. Furthermore, we the Populares, the People's Front of Rome so to speak, hope that it is not considered a personal attack if we dare to ask the reputable user Rubenstein what exactly he thinks it is that qualifies him to act as the expert for and supervisor over this particular article. If does not deem us worthy of an answer, as has been the case a few times on this page, maybe other editors or just readers could try to help us understand. In any case, we fail to see why Slrubenstein's arbitrary words and deeds should carry any special weight for the decent normal Wikipedians. We also don't understand why there seems to be so little opposition to what appears to be his self-arrogated authority. So in closing we ask an unbiased and honest administrator—there certainly must be one around here—to remove the editing protection from the article so that some much needed reasonable work can be done by knowledgeable and sincere editors.

22000326,"` DEAR Anonymous EE Guy, Well, I don't know if you really mean to give a full picture of the case, but we could include this one: [URL] [URL] Who are the web site of Jean-Pierre Voyer, a kind of model person for mister Messager/YBM, and who spred a quiet special form for ideologie, which goal is to play with words and how to defend and argue about things who do not exist, how to play with words and ``fuck others`` as phrased on his web site, and essentialy, how to display a superior attitude in order to effectively use the communication on internet to their full interest, by using the circumstances frame of the dialogues. This include displaying lies as being facts with such a forcefullness as to convince others. It is called: postsituationnisme, ideologie who is followed by YBM, together with a sympathie to the 3rd reich, and a, by some, called pseudo-Hégelianism. YBM run his forum where he defend the man and his positions, with as much furore as he dispells those of Igor and Grichka Bogdanov. You will found in it concepts as the Superior Race, versus the inferior race, and different creativs ways to talk the technics and language of publicity into a way of ``mass communication`` and a weapon to convince anyone of anything. I am sure that this angle will bring a certain shade of light where it was upmost needed, and will constitute the missing piece of the puzzle. I hope you will excuse my very late assertion or révélation about this subject, but I was myself only made aware of it for a very short time ago, together with the fact that this Voyer and YBM have harrassed people before, writers too, for books who had nothing to do with science, but nevertheless constituted those 2 mens lifes mening for 2 years. Actually they stopped with their first victims at the end of 2002, beginning of 2003, to consacrate their cherish technics of manipulating the masses, and ideologies of diffamation on 2 other subjects, Igor and Grichka Bogdanov. No need to say that the 2 former victims are still paying for the vices of Voyer and Messager, and that their lifes and career have been destroyed. Why so much hate against people they didn't knew and had never met? They were only practicing, like serial killers start somewhere, in the shadow, and are only known for much more exposed actions. Here are some other links who do compleete the picture: The first attacks of Voyer and YBM against XAVIER, the writer: [URL] [URL] [URL] YBM Web site: [URL] Site Voyer: [URL] [URL] I consider this information for being central in the matter at hand, as all accusations will have fallen and nothing much will have come from the original and following J. Baez paper on the subject if it hadn't been for Messager and Voyers' questionnable work in the name of very questionnable motives, all accomplished to serve a completely useless ideology. I think that this will teach us all a lesson regarding objectivity and our hability to evaluate a given problem properly, and to be able to use our sense of sceptisisme ans sound judgement.

I believe that currently the educated thought is that inline 6-cylinder engines can fit into a tighter space profile with accessories such as air compressors, allowing truck hoods to be sized smaller. ::The reason might be that the inline 6-cylinder engines are obviously of a much simpler configuration since there is only one bank of cylinders verses two banks of a ``V`` design. Also, there are significantly fewer high-precision parts in a 6-cylinder engine verses an 8-cylinder engine (e.g. pistons, connecting rods, valves, injectors). Routing of intake air and exhaust gas is simpler in an inline engine verses a ``V`` type engine. Thus, an inline 6-cylinder is easier and less expensive to design, manufacture, and maintain than a V-type 8-cylinder. Additionally, I believe the inline 6 design is more efficient than the V8 because there is less heat loss. Four-cycle V8 diesel truck engines were manufactured for class 8 trucks by both Caterpillar (e.g. the 3408) and Cummins (e.g. the 903) up until the early to mid 70's. Detroit Diesel stopped making 2-cycle engines for motor vehicles because those engines were incapable of meeting the more stringent exhaust gas emission requirements.—Preceding unsigned comment added by 04:53, 11 August 2009 `",False,dev

I pointed out to user Dinesh Kannambadi about one portion of text mentioned in the article on the Western Chalukyas. The said portion is copied in here for your information and consideration as an admin: The overall effort by Somesvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Somesvara IV into exile in Banavasi 1189. After the fall of the Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time.[44] This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.[45] In the above passage, while it may be ok for giving info on kingdoms in western deccan or deccan whose mutual antagonisms filled history annals.... I feel that mentioning the demise of the Cholas (who did so in 1279/1285 AD) in the Chalukya page who got eclipsed in 1190 WHICH IS ALMOST 90 YEARS PRIOR TO THAT OF THE CHALUKYAS, is quite inappropriate. Mr.Kannambadi also mentions that the Chalukyas convincingly eclipsed the Cholas after the Cholas lost Vengi is quite untrue. This is because Vengi was lost by the Chalukyas to the Cholas themselves under Vikrama Chola for after winning Vengi in 1119 or 1118, Vikramaditya expired in 1125 or so and was followed by very weak successors and the Chalukya capital itself was lost for around 30 years from 1136-1140 (courtesy, Ancient India by K.A.N.Sastri, 1956 edition). So what does he mean there, by winning Vengi and keeping it for 6-8 years the Cholas were convincingly eclipsed by the Chalukyas... Does it mean that we are to believe that sustaining a victory for 6-8 years enables an empire to claim glory or feeling that their opponents were convincingly eclipsed. I know Kannambadi will also speak about jingoism and that Hoysalas too won Gangavadi from Cholas, but pls. remind him that the same was prior to the Chalukyas conquering Vengi. I am sure you will be very well acquainted with these facts in case you have in-depth knoweldge of Indian History especially that of South India.

Some with a strong FYROM POV around here argue that 'Republic of Macedonia' is the only official name in use and wish to lock it in at Wikipedia. :While true many nations and NGO's have chosen in the interim to use ``Republic of Macedonia``... all nations in principle agree to honour whatever name FYROM/Greece can hammer out. When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing. Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name). :What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms, why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.) :Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use :FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as ``Republic of Macedonia`` even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states ::``the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993). (which is still be FYROM I believe) :Agreement Violation #2:: Refrain from propaganda against Greek cultural heritage and territory :Article 7 and 11 of the UN agreement between Greece and FYROM state:. ::``Each Party shall promptly take effective measures to prohibit hostile activities or propaganda by State-controlled agencies and to discourage acts by private entities likely to incite violence, hatred or hostility against each other. ::If either Party believes one or more symbols constituting part of its historic or cultural patrimony is being used by the other Party, it shall bring such alleged use to the attention of the other Party, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action or indicate why it does not consider it necessary to do so. :The article should probably include a few real world examples to show the complaints are very real. I myself recently heard someone from FYROM claim Aristotle was actually Slavic on a forum but there are literally thousands of examples of irredentist behavior to be found. (a small subset of some recent examples that seemed relevant, verifiable and seemingly demonstrate the argument beyond the abstract) ::*There exists a steady stream of FYROM supporters on the Alexander_the_Great article history page claiming Alexander wasn't Greek. ::*Top ranked FYROM websites almost universally are writing revisionist histories that suggest Alexander was not Greek (quote taken from the website) :::``Contrary to modern Greek claims, Macedonia was never part of Greece, and the ancient Macedonians were not regarded as ancient Greeks.`` ::*Current FYROM Prime Minister welcomes Pakistan “Macedonian” Prince Ghazanfar and uses it as ``proof`` of their ancient Macedonian roots. That one really made me cringe considering not so long ago everyone was being assured by FYROM leadership... :::'``We are Slavs, who came to the region in the sixth century. We are not descendants of the ancient Macedonians.``' Kiro Gligorov (FYROM's first President) :::'``We are not related to the northern Greeks who produced leaders like Philip and Alexander the Great.

That doesn't make his claims true, but the claims themselves are plausible as claims, and as claims they are reported in legitimate secondary sources.

That is the real point of the IQ claims, and it is the basis of the interest in Mr Langan, since people are interested in the limits of how frickin' smart people can be.

While we can look at a picture at all wavelengths, it is only in the visible spectrum that information on this picture (patterns and variations) start to appear (at other wavelengths, its blank). An analogy would be satellites using SARs to pierce the cloud cover of Venus and image its surface. There is little information in the visible spectrum but lots outside of it. If the information is encoded in a digital form (eg: RGB) rather than displayed using our technology, then they will interpret it in colors they can see as this encoding is not relative to a specific spectrum.

(sic)`` You only say you don't care now since it's been revealed you were wrong. It's another instance where you shift the argument when you've been proven wrong and engage in a smear campaign. And what do you mean by, ``behind your back``? That would mean that he would've said ``idiot`` somewhere he knows you're not going to look (like, say, the History tab, which you don't seem to know about). Presumably, someone who bothers to edit the NTFS page would clearly read its associated Talk page. So, once again, you've failed to provide the evidence, and again, shift blame and bring up wholly irrelevant issues to cover your tracks. It reminds me of Michael Brown being questioned by Congress. You've failed to demonstrate you had the correct facts. You've failed to justify your ideology that wikipedia should only be limited to what you deem ``mainstream``. And you've failed demonstrate any evidence for your ad hominem attacks, instead, insulting our intelligence by pointing out blaringly obvious facts and insinuating that we are stupid (unlike DrPizza, your language leaves no room for such doubt, and your profile clearly indicates you have no issues with the North American dialect of the English languageOr are you going to backtrack away from your earlier broken argument about language and intention now?), and casting blame in all directions, hoping it sticks somewhere. These are signs of gross immaturity and a complete failure to be able to put forth a rational, logical argument. These are your faults, not ours. Not DrPizza`",True,dev

180239182,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 A math-wiki: You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property: A) 1=3(1/3) B) 3(1/3) = 3(0.333...) C) 3(0.333...) =0.999... The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any radix system. You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r such that a=bq + r and 0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then what are the integers q and r such that the above is true? Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively. For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times. Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction: 1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!! I want the world to know what f..g idiots run this site. You are a bunch of retarded, conceited fools who I look upon with the utmost hatred and condemnation.

Then you proceeded to ridicule what you perceive as my religious beliefs, while simultaneously confessing to me the past two days (if it wasn't one more blind) your faith in Haile Selassie, the long dead ruler of Ethiopia as God Almighty! If you want to talk patronizingly about religious beliefs, I could make one fine case out of that, but instead you want to rail and reduce Wikipedia to a Britannica Junior Encyclopedia and below. Why don't you go pick on someone else! CONSTANCE. `",True,dev

THF was the first AEI director I had the misfortune to encounter. When he saw my edits, which he didn't like, he came after me with a vengeance, and lobbied for me to be banned on Wikipedia. He defamed me on his talk site (yes, I am aware of the meaning of the word, since I also am an attorney). It was defamation - libel, to be exact - and removed after a time, when I threatened suit. I know Wiki doesn't like that - but it reaps what it sows. THF threatened me and my husband with frivolous litigation OUTSIDE of Wikipedia, and we called him on it. We never heard from him again. At that time, Wiki cliques would not or could not listen to what I had to say, and what had occurred. I have no idea if I am ``banned`` or not, and don't care at this point. After the Kafkaesque experience, I never want to edit again here. That said, I am grateful that you and it appears some others were able to expose him for what he is - even if it took a different issue entirely. (I had no particular interest in the Michael Moore debate). The AEI is one of the most powerful political influences in the Republican party. THF was quite an eye-opener for me. Rarely have I ever seen anyone so ruthlessly disparage others, with false ``information``. I can only guess what he does ``professionally``. THF is a public figure. His attempt to hide out at Wikipedia claiming it was only a ``hobby`` was laughable. It was astonishing that anyone fell for it, but many did. Good for you for calling him on it.

616529617,"` :Binksternet's paranoid and frightening theory propounded about Geraldine Edwards is both unwarranted and inappropriate. He has no grounds or factual element to support his theory in general, which is pure conjecture and supposition. What's more, it's not his place within the rules of Wikipedia editing to mount a personal editorial based on his personal feelings towards a person. His hypothesis that a rouge IP editor from San Diego mounted a campaign to raise the profile of Geraldine Edwards to the level of Bebe Buell, slander Mary Ambrose, and attach Geraldine Edwards to the creation of Almost Famous is so preposterous as to be laughable. Other Wikipedia editors who have tried to defend Geraldine Flemming-Mueller against Binksternet's attacks upon her were met with threats leveled by him. His interest in Geraldine Flemming-Mueller is unhealthy and alarming, and it would be in his best interest to step away from this situation altogether, as he fails to maintain a neutral stance, which is one of Wikipedia's precepts, on the subject of her. That being said, Geraldine Edwards is not a 'hoax', she's simply a woman who's living the life she see's fit, and is not interested in being included in Wikipedia articles. And finally, posting any inappropriate, hostile information against a living person that may harm them is clearly being flouted by Binkstenet's many malignant comments posted on Wikipedia's pages regarding Geraldine Edwards, one of the main guiding principles of Wikipedia. It's time for him to stand down. The San Diego college angle is still quite active with regard to Geraldine Edwards; see User_talk:Zabadu#Geraldine_Edwards_is_not_a_hoax which was started by the IP 130.191.109.76 registered to San Diego State University.[17] This writer said ``Approximately a couple of years ago when Mary Ambrose was visiting San Francisco, she met Binksternet, and they became friendly,`` a statement that is complete bunk. Nothing in the IP's post is supported by reliable sources. All of this effort to defame Ambrose and build up Edwards is astonishingly trivial. It is a waste of my time, a waste of Mark's time and a drag on Wikipedia to have to deal with it. As long as there are no reliable sources to back up the allegations, they must stay out of the encyclopedia. Editors who repeatedly disrupt Wikipedia are usually blocked. Binksternet (talk) Whatever. Binksternet gives new credence to the phrase ``Legend in his own mind``. Although I respect many Wikipedia editors for their diligent, accurate and commendable contributions, Binksternet is not numbered among them. In no way will I and many others link his name to veracity and credibility. His deny, deny, deny style reminiscent of certain members of the government is amusing if nothing else. Unfortunately, this diatribe has impressed me with nothing of any value. This matter is settled and over and done with, and this is the last time I will edit on this subject on these pages. Thank you to Mark Arsten for acting in a competent, intelligent and unbiased manner here, and my apologies to him for any potential problems my editing may have caused him regarding this subject. Thank you. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 174.77.220.178 (talk) Just so you know - I am nowhere near San Diego, haven't been to the college EVER and am not using an alias. You quote a retired Wiki editor who can no longer speak for himself, yet made edits to your article based on your inability to show credibility. Fuck off. `",True,dev

374408751,"` Reply to ``On gender`` Your posted: Don't guess at someone's gender, as you have done here. It is uncivil, and could in fact be taken as insult. Any argument you might have that their 'name appears to be that of a female/woman' is invalid, as you have no idea if that is their name, last name, middle name.. etc. It could even be a reference to the male comicbook character Blade, who had the name of Daywalker given to him by others in the comic book.— :If you know your friend’s gender, spit it out, you stupid ass. Your entire posting, if you didn’t have the agenda I ascribe to you, infra, would have been “FYI: He/she is a female/male” and I would adjust accordingly. Hell, if you tell me that Dayewalker is a consortium, and I’d refer to Dayewalker as “they/it.” Don’t continue to be an ass if you post further, or understand that your further postings are unworthy of reply. :I note that you are not correcting your friend Dayewalker when she posts to you 6 days ago ``I saw that afterwards, I knew HE was topic banned but it had slipped my mind about the overall bannation. Thanks! Dayewalker (talk) 06:48, 13 July 2010.`` Are suggesting that you know that Dayewalker has completed genetic testing on the subject of her comment, so that he (Dayewalker) is not guessing at ‘his” gender (the subject of her (Dayewalker’s) comment) when he only refers to ``he’;`` or that he (Dayewalker) has genetic evidence that the ``he`` is actually a ``she`` and she (Dayewalker) is insulting them by suggesting that the ``he`` is too ballsy or pushy to be a woman/“lady.” Dayewalker is not whining about this unintended insult of either referring to a woman as “she” or equally unintended insult of referring to a man as “she.” Don't be an ass. :If Dayewalker, or anyone, is so concerned about their gender identification, and they are not an idiot, they will use a prefix like ``Mr.`` or ``Ms.`` Dayewalker has not said anything about it and it is off topic to the discussion. If you wish to join into the discussion, please feel free. On second thought, don’t join in. I have no confidence that you would answer the questions posed by the other editor either. Dayewalker (he she, they, etc.) doesn’t answer his question. Ut oh, now I’ve called Chowbok a “he.” No doubt her boyfriend/girlfriend will rush in to call me a “beast” and start a fight on the 2nd grade playground. If Dayewalker thinks that he has been called a ``sissy`` or a ``girlie,`` then she can address that with me. He doesn't need a mighty protector to create issues designed to get me banned. And by ``protector,`` I mean you. You are an ass. Male. Female. Both. Neither. And of whatever ‘sexual orientation,” if any, that you wish to use to identify yourself, or not identify yourself, or feel the need to identify yourself, or feel the need to keep private, or over which you do not care.

Forgive my antagonism but I give only as much as I receive, and I have most certainly received a substantial quantity from you. You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in ``chat-rooms`` and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment.

You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical ``angry`` way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be.

What the motherfucking hell is up with people these days? Nick's people obviously smoked lots and LOTS of crack in 2004! I love Old SPongeBob. New SpongeBob. I don't blame SB. I blame FUCKING PAUL TIBBIT!!!! SCREW YOU PAUL!!!! Thanks to that man-hag SpongeBob is completely f++ked up. Now, all Nick Studios cares about is money! And i Mean ONLY MONEY!!! They can do an episode where SpongeBob fucking laughs like a fucking pedophile for 20 minutes straight and NOT CARE AT ALL!!! All these people give a tinker's damn about is money, ratings, and fucking fame and fortune. These guys are like celebrities in disgize! They try hard yet put so little effort into their shows JUST to make a quick damned buck! The new episodes drive me nuts!

Nick's people these days are obviously on tons of marijuana! These drunk dunces have no idea in hell what cartoon quality is ALL ABOUT! It would've been WAY better if they just slaughtered this crappy series after the movie!!!! Why watch this shit anymore when Paul Tibbit DESTROYED SPONGEBOB!!!!!! Little do I understand the appeal of the new SpongeBob. I can't believe Paul Tibbit can actually get away with screwing around with a phenominal TV show like he's on freaking cocaine or something! P. Tibbit should be on trial and should get the death penalty is he's considered guilty.

You seek to raise the IGNORANCE of manufacturers of folk and rock instruments to a virtue, to a new musicological convention. The centuries-old academic convention that obviously predates rock musicians maintains that a pair of strings is termed a course and instruments with courses are named for their number of COURSES. You ``convention`` you mention that contradicts this is nothing more than ignorance you wish to dress up as something more. Tell me, Andrew Alder (church drummer and rhythm guitarist who has never in his life played an actual ``ten-string guitar``), if you notate music for a coursed instrument, do you write 12 or 10 separate lines in tablature? NO. You write one per course, which is in practical musical effect one string. If you write it in musical notation (can you even read this??? I doubt highly), would you use numbered circles up to 10 or 12 for each so-called individual string? NO! You would notate the first two strings as a circled number 1, the second pair of strigns as a circled 2, the 5th and 6th strings as a circled number 3, etc. These instruments are COURSED! For all practical purposes these instruments are NOT ``ten-string guitars`` (with the hypen) a term that has come to signify a specific instrument, an instument you are obscuring and confusing by introducing misinformative garbage. You deserve no less than uncivility. I wil let you play at being a musicologist for a few weeks/months until I have the time to undo your work. So play ahead. `",True,dev

Just because there is an old connection to people in Iberia dont make English related to Spaniards. That connection is old and shared by all west European peeps. English and Spanish have mixed with other origins and NO ONE (Syke, Oppen, whatev) think that Brits are completely descended from that old population. Ethnicity is a bunch of things, including descent, but without descent, theres no ethnicity, there is other things that are part of it but not identical to it. Our appearance comes from some of our genes, yeah ? Basques look different from Spaniards and they both def look alot different from Irish, and Brits ! Brits and Irish look more like each other and nearby peeps like dutch and germans more than people from Iberia. The connection to Iberia is a PARTIAL one, got it ? Anyway, in ethnicity, you can say any people is related to anyone, as long as theyre human, right ? Brits and Irish are related a little bit to peeps in Iberia, but its a PARTIAL and REALLY OLD connection. Brits and Irish are also related in the same way to all Western Europeans but mostly to each other. English and Scottish have that same really old Iberian link with Scandinavians, Frisians, Germans, but also other genetic links that they dont have with people in Iberia.

Jack Forbes gave as good as he got – and my point about him stands. Are you green-lighting Jack Forbes in a general sense ? (and why get involved?) I do need to know this now, as my time is valuable to me: I am questioning why I am on Wikipedia every day at the moment: it has to make sense to me. I remember you from the BI nationality dispute (before you were an admin?) - are you too close to this do you think? Please answer these questions. :Actually don't bother: when I look at your opening line ``you've been warned time and again for incivility, personal attacks, edit warring, etc.`` (``etc`` for heaven's sake? Isn't the rest exaggerated enough!) - it simply makes me look like a bad Wikipedian. I'm just not having that. Less than 50% of admins seem to be up to the job, and unfortunately I always feel there should be more. Is worth me staying? Honestly - No. I could appeal yes, but what's the point?: Wikipedia has got to the hysterical point where editing is too-often seen as a crime (and a mark against your name), any old joe can throw around official-looking warnings (do you see me doing it?), too-busy admins simply head-count everything, and incidents are not treated on merit, but on a perceived ``reputation``. Name a developed country that works like that? It is a catch I can't see myself getting out of. I have a lot I still planned to do, but I can't see the merit in staying: Wikipedia has vast power and needs value-driven guideline-obeying people like myself - it is mainly the politicised who seem to understand the power of this place - but life is full of other things, and I can't see myself fitting in here anymore. RETIRED I'm trying to think of who to say goodbye to. One guy's left himself over the farce with football. CarterBar - good luck. RolandR springs to mind. There's a motley bunch at Alzheimer's.
