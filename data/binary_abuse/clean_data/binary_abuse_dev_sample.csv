16500,207182449,"`, 21 April 2008 (UTC) Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too. There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial. Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject. According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me. He did not do that. He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do. And ``Final warning`` suggests a previous warning had been given. I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse. Oh well, what are you gonna do. The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think). He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too. I suspect the ``batman`` comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman). But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter). The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority. But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia. Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life! 19:15`",dev,False

I can't yet directly prove it with contemporaneous documents, but I do believe that force protection was one of his concerns, based on both his statements after the fact and the general nature of the debate at the time, about which the dangers posed to the Marine deployment was constantly being discussed. (See this NYT story or this NYT op-ed from a former Senator, both published earlier in September 1983, just as a couple of examples.) I think the 'Marines as sitting ducks' context was implicit in what McCain was saying, and that the 'no forseeable objectives' conclusion meant that casualties weren't worth taking (of course, no one expected the extent to which the casualties would disastrously occur). The larger point is that opponents of ill-advised military involvements rarely foresee all of what will go wrong or exactly what shape the wrong will take, but they still usually get credit for recognizing that the involvement is misguided. This is true of early critics of the Vietnam War, for example. Or take Iraq: during the Democratic primaries, Obama got much of his base support for having opposed the war initially while Hillary supported it, yet when you look at Obama's famous 2002 speech, you'll see there's really only one sentence in it warning about the occupation ``I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a US occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.`` It's not like he was predicting, say, the depths to which the occupation would reach in the 2006 period. But he still got credit for his opposition to the war (from those opposed to the war), and rightly so. So, in sum, if we include Lebanon, I favor the inclusion of as much of the above subarticle text in the main article as Ferrylodge's thou-shalt-grow-no-larger commandment allows. `",dev,False
1077,18301411,"`'s rule (1924-1953) - 40-60 million (but at least 20) million dead.`` Some editors find this number highly exagerated (the original text simply said ``20 million or more dead``). The proponents of the higher numbers cite this quote in their support: * ``According to Roy Medvedev, Stalin's victims numbered forty million. Solzhenitsyn says the number is far greater-perhaps sixty million. The debate continues even now.`` From the book: Lenin's Tomb The Last Days of the Soviet Empire by DAVID REMNICK (p. 129). My question is. Are the numbers cited above (40-60 million dead) reasonable or do these numbers include Gulag prisoners who survived? I know that it is difficult to estimate the death toll, but what are the most authorative sources on this subject? Can you help me find a reasonable range for estimation and the best sources to support it? I appreciate your help. :Most mainstream western historians give a figure of 10-20 million; that is itself probably a considerable overestimate. Info box inaccuracies I think there something wrong with the infobox (the top one with the picture) and the succession boxes at the bottom. First the infobox says his term of office was from 1922-1953 (I assume we are talking about the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, here, so I added that in). But if we are talking about the office of General Secretary, how can we say Lenin was the successor, as Stalin was the first General Secretary? Also, I'm not as sure about this, but I believe all Soviet leaders following Stalin were known as ``First Secretaries``, so Malenkov doesn't technically work as a successor either, I don't think. Also, the successor box on the bottom for General Secretary is definitely wrong, as Stalin was the first and Lenin never held that position, he was the Chairman, and indeed granted Stalin his position. Didn't want to make changes without consensus. :The ``secretary`` position was that of the top boss of the Soviet Communist Party. There is no reason to play technicalities about a particular ``office`` with a specific title. The issue is pretty confusing and there is no reason to put these intricacies in an infobox. At the same time, I agree that the formal details about party leadership must be addressed more carefully in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union article. ::It's just that I assumed, with such specific info there, dealing with de facto leadership is tricky. Perhaps if the infobox said it was only leader, that would help. But that's not the common convention. For George Washington, to use an example of a first officeholder, we don't say preceded by George III, or whomever, just because that is the leader. Well... on second thought that's not the best example, because it's a different country. But what I'm trying to say there's got to be a better way to do it without implying that Stalin and his predecessor and his successor all held the same title. Modern opinion What about people's opinion of Stalin in modern Russia? It could be quite interesting. Certain segments of the population removed: :, and by providing certain segments of the population benefits so as to win their support or co-opt them into the regime. What the heck these ``certain segments`` are? If bureaucracy is in mind, then this is of no special note: at all times in every state a bureaucrat lives better than a peasant. Apart of these (with a special subclass of apparatchiks), there were no benefitted segments. Moscow Minor quibble, but shouldn't the article at least mention, and possibly elaborate on Stalin's decision to stay in Moscow as German forces approached in December of 1941? As I understand it, practically every government official evacuated, but Stalin was adamant in his decision to remain. Seems a significant enough event to include here.

EVERYTHING IN THE BIBLE TRAVELS IN TRINITIES, THREES, but all in one Christ. He... Remember, the first time to redeem His Church, the second time to receive His Church, the third time with His Church, as King and Queen.

Scholars ALSO use the term ``typology,`` but usually only in twos. I'll add more references from the THOUSANDS of them out there later. 3) You demonstrate your ignorance of the Bible and Jewish traditions: Citing that John said Jesus ``went up to the feast of the Dedication which is held in the winter,`` i.e. HANUKKAH, is NOT ``original research.`` ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE BIBLE (which you don't) KNOWS that ``the feast of the dedication that is held in the winter IS HANUKKAH.

Your email You have no right to do that. Firstly, I'm not Antony, secondly, I don't even like the guy, thirdly, its all true. What right do you have to just assume something is made up? I don't go around flagging other peoples work when I feel they are either misled or ignorant on a subject. How about you take your Cambridge degree and stuff it up your arse. Starting from your first point - I have utter right to do that. Every time you edit a page, you put your contributions under the GFDL; underneath the edit box is a note, in bold, as follows: Please note: *If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it. The page on Antony Phillips, whether or not it was you, was non-encyclopaedic. If you're not Antony and don't like him, then why are you putting up an article that lights up his antics? Why was that the only subject of your interest at Wikipedia? Why are you defending the deletion of that page at all? The page was utterly full of positive spin; many of the links that attested to his notability were redlinks (``Full Metal Blazer``? The entire thing sounds like a spoof, for drama class at school. That is NOT worthy of inclusion in a worldwide encyclopaedia; the phrase gets one single (myspace) hit on Google. That is nowhere near famous. That's so antifamous it's pathetic), and his current notability was listed as ``famous simply for being famous``. That is utter and total bullcrap. I assumed it was made up because of the way the page attempted to portray the subject as famous; while the subject of the article is an unfamous schoolboy. Whether or not it's true isn't even relevant; the page simply isn't notable. The subject of the article is not worthy of having an encyclopedia article. If you're not Antony, you shouldn't even care. Note also that I flagged the article for deletion - I didn't flag it for speedy deletion, I put it to the vote of the Wikipedia community. You didn't get any supporting votes; an admin then speedy deleted the article because it had no support. Wikipedia is used as a reference site by many schools, and combining that with the fact that a lot of you are bored/mischievous/etc, we get pages and pages and pages of crap. So much that guideline pages are written about it. When an article is about a student, and contains no notability other than assured notability within that school, then it is not going to survive. Whether it's me or someone else that flags it first, it's going to go. If you believe that the article should be reinstated, then go and contest it. Cite your sources. Add references. Make it sound remotely believable rather than made up. Then it might survive nomination for deletion. Better yet, find something else and make it better, like you did with the Abbey Road article. That'd be welcome. Especially - take note! - those where you can go around flagging other peoples work when you feel they are wrong. Make it right yourself - or flag it so someone else can correct it if you're not sure. The template is good for this if you know something's wrong with a page but aren't sure how to fix it yourself. This is an encyclopedia that strives to be correct - if something is wrong, why leave it wrong? As for the last, I'll point you to the first paragraph in my reply . That was someone else who didn't like their article deleted; they went on an edit rampage, vandalising pages, insulting people, and generally being a pain. Thank you for at least being more restrained than that - but my achievements there are national and international, sporting and charitable and academic and active. That list far exceeds the contributions of Antony Phillips, and yet I still don't believe that's notable enough to warrant an article. Everyone does things. However there are 6 billion people in the world. There's 65 million in the UK. Why does Wikipedia have only barely over a million articles? Because it only contains people who are actually famous - not every person who's been in a drama production at school. I suggest you have a little think about my reasoning; I'm fairly sure you'll still take this personally, but I'm one of those who assumes good faith. If you're still up in arms about an article that you claim isn't even about yourself, then to be honest I'd be quite worried about your mental health. If it was about yourself and you just wanted to be seen as being objective - then please bear in mind what this project is about, and I hope you can come around to improving it. Your second email Ok, I didn't want to resort to this. You are a cock.

Part of this course was an update of a Wikipedia entry of our choice. Below you can find the modified entry. I am happy about all kinds of feedback and comment. - Lupinus mutabilis is a species of lupines grown in the Andes, mainly for its edible bean. Vernacular names include tarwi, tarhui, chocho, altramuz, Andean lupin, South American lupin, Peruvian field lupin, or pearl lupin.Lost crops of the Incas: little-known plants of the Andes with promise for worldwide cultivation / report of an ad hoc panel of the Advisory Committee on Technology Innovation, Board on Science and Technology for International Development, National Research Council. - Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1989, page 180-189. There are different aspects why L. mutabilis could become an important international crop. But until now, the high content of alkaloids in the seed is the main reason, why the crop is not very known outside the Andes. This content could be decreased by different processes. Origin and Dissemination The origin of L. mutabilis has been identified in the Andean region of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.Neglected crops: 1492 from a different perspective / ed. by J. E. Hernández Bermejo and J. León; publ. in collab. with the Botanical Garden of Córdoba (Spain) as part of the Etnobotánica 92 Programme (Andalusia, 1992). - Rome Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 1994. In this area, the greatest genetic variability in the world was found.The plant has been domesticated for more than 1500 years, mostly because of its high protein content. Biology L. mutabilis is an annual plant. The steam is hollow and highly branched. Plant height reaches from 0.5 to 2.80 meters, depending on the environmental conditions and the genomic properties. Due to the high vegetative growth, species from northern South America are taller than species from the southern Andean region. El cultivo y la utilización del tarwi: Lupinus mutabilis sweet / por Rainer Gross. - Roma: Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentación, 1982. The genome contains 2n = 48 chromosomes and there is a high genomic variation, which leads to big differences in morphology. Several architectural types of L. mutabilis exist. Most common is the branching in V-form, this type has the highest biomass production. The basal branching type has the positive feature that its infructescence is at the same level. This species is preferably promoted because of its early ripening, stability and the homogeny seed quality. Morphology The fruit is a 5-12 cm long pod, depending on the amount of seed. One pod contains on average 2-3 seeds, but can have up to 9 seeds per pod. The thousand-seed weight (TSW) is around 200g. Leaves are palmate and have a typical appearance: one leave is divided in five to twelve leaflets, which have an oval or lanceolate form. The form is typical for Faboideaes. The corolla reaches 1-2 cm and contains five petals. Variation in coloration is high and reaches from white to purple. The white coloration is recessive to purple. L. mutabilis has a strong taproot reaching 3 m length. Like all Leguminosae secondary roots build nodules containing bacteria for nitrogen fixation. Development The growing cycle varies from 150 to 360 days, depending on the genotype, altitude and environmental conditions. Phenological phases are: emergence, first true leaf, formation of the raceme on the central stem, flowering, podding, pod ripening, and physiologica",dev,False

18393,1958817,"` I've found a misplaced reference showing that ``generatics`` did not start with me in content, only in name. The book, ``Learn from the Masters``, edited by Dwetz, Fauvel, Bekken, Johannsson, Katz (Mathematical Association of America, 1991), says on p. 286, ``It was not until 1894 that J. Tannery introduced the arithmetic of rationals as pairs [vectors] of integers.`` (Jules Tannery (1818-1910), French, is cited ONLINE.)In 1957, I received a grant from the National Science Foundation to organize the first NSF Workshop in Puerto Rico, planned for high math school teachers (some from States). I taught ``Foundations of Mathematics``. I was sent papers (later lost) from previous Workshops. One set described Tannery's work and Hamilton's formulation of complex numbers as pairs or vectors of reals. The formulator filled in by deriving integers from pairs or vectors of natural numbers. The latter shows how ``the law of signs`` derives from CLOSURE on DEFINED DIFFERENCES (DDs) of naturals (a - b), s.t. subtrahend is not greater than minuend, hence, a natural number. Critical is multiplication law for DD. From standard multiplication algorithm, find that, for DDs, (a - b) * (c - d) = (a*c + (-b)*(-d)) + (a*(-d) + (-b)*c). Applying, 10 = 5*2 = (9 - 4)*(2 - 0) = 18 + (-4)*(2) + 0 = 10, hence, (-4)*(2) must act as a subtrahend -8, leading to ``negative times positive equals negative`` rule. Applying product rule to 30 = 6*5 = (9 - 3) - (7 - 2) = (63 + (-3)*(-2)) - (18 + 21) = (63 - 39) + (-3)*(-2) = 24 + x = 30, hence, x = 6 = (-3)*(-2), leading to ``negative times negative equals positive`` rule. This is forced by CLOSURE on DDs. However, in the ``Generating arithmetic`` article which I initiated, some one put in that CLOSURE is a concept from category theory, very advanceed math. Yet, the above book, on p. 260, says, ``For Galois (1830), Jordan (1870), and even in Klein's ``Lectures on the Icosohedron`` (1884), groups were defined by the one axiom of closure. The other axioms were implicit in the context of their discussions finite groups of transformations.`` So CLOSURE goes back at least to 1830.Jonhays0`",dev,False

I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism.`` Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of ``traditional`` values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture.

This should result in a more harmonious and co-operative environment in which DP London can hold conferences in Britain and continue it’s work in highlighting human rights abuses in Bangladesh and help make it a more effective organisation. Please signal your position regarding this communiqué. -The appointment of a British or Bangladeshi-born (Sylheti-speaking) Sylheti as executive of Drishtipat (DP) London. Thus accurately reflecting the overwhelmingly Sylheti character to the British Bangladeshi community and Sylheti concerns. -An official statement of regret on the DP website that thorough research of the composition of the British Bangladeshi community was not initially undertaken. This oversight resulting in DP London conducting their campaign of 2006 on behalf of Dhaka-based garments workers. A worthy cause but one better suited for a DP Chapter whose constituency is less monolithic in it’s regional and cultural composition than Britain. -Official confirmation that Faisal Ghazi (of Golmal blog fame) and Zubaer, DP members of ill-fame, have either been disciplined or preferably removed from DP’s campaigns. Their disparaging and outright racist remarks about British Sylheti’s on their blogs merits nothing less. -The celebration of the achievements of ALL diaspora Bangladeshis. Not selected members such as author Tahmima Anam, (under the guise of concern for human rights) whom certain DP members may know from their time in Dhaka. This means the celebration of British Bangladeshi’s born and bought up in the UK as well, such as Rabina Khan and Abdul Ahad. -DP to become a genuine human rights organisation. This means concentration on bread and butter issues such as providing clean drinking water, inoculation and freedom from corruption and not 101 blog posts about the Awami League and the upcoming (irrelelevant) elections in Bangladesh. Drishtipat's greatest disservice to the Bangladeshi Human Rights/NGO sector is that they have made NGO work controversial by making it party-political.

One of our WP co-editors seems to be pursuing a political agenda bent on defaming Israel by its action in the winter of 1948, when I have insisted that he/she remain neutral, and not to politicize the situation. Specifically, the person prefers to mention Bayt Nattif of October 1948 as a ``Palestinian-Arab village,`` when I propose that it is far better to simply write ``Arab village,`` since in October of 1948 Bayt Nattif was then under the direct governance of the new government of Israel, based on the partition plan relegated to Israeli and Jordanian authorities by the dissolved British Mandate. To suggest that Bayt Nattif was, in October of 1948, a ``Palestinian-Arab village`` is to suggest a sovereign governmental body by the name of Palestine given charge over the village's affairs when it was actually the new State of Israel that had been given charge over its affairs. To avoid this seemingly contentious view, I have suggested keeping the introductory lines neutral in accordance with WP policy of WP:NPOV and by simply writing ``Arab village.`` (For a greater summary, go to WP article's Bayt Nattif's Talk Page, bottom section.

The sectin in question was changed to: ``It is known that the theoretical maximum electrical resistivity for water is approximately 182 kilohm-meters at 25 degrees Celsius. This figure agrees well with what is typically seen on reverse osmosis, ultrafiltered and deionized ultrapure water systems used for instance, in semiconductor manufacturing plants. A salt or acid contaminant level exceeding that of even 100 parts per trillion (ppt) in ultrapure water will begin to noticably raise its conductivity level by up to several hundred kilosiemens per meter.`` Now, I know wikipedia must conform to standards, a policy which I am an ardent advocate of, and the meter is the SI unit of length as is the kilohm. However, ultrapure water is never, ever referred to using these units. It is always referred to as being 18.2 megohm-cm and has in fact been so often used with these terms that it has bcome synonymous with them and is often simply called ``megohm water`` in the literature.

Tim and Eric's sense for comedy, attention to detail and timing is undeniable. From Eric's ornamental hot dog preparation technique to Tim's running ``one-eye-open`` gag, their original and admittedly experimental to the point of absurd jokes are a nice change from current comedy programming. You never know where the next sketch (or even the current sketch) will go. The ``Doo Dah Doo Doo`` sketch is a perfect example of this (``Now think about your dad!``). This sketch, as obscure as it is, ties in with another sketch at the end of the show in a clever way - no doubt the result of having Bob Odenkirk, formerly of Mr. Show, on board.

14188,29066087,"` see [URL] exposing Wikipedia's lying liars & their lies There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology? Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance [URL] that reveal its original straight-arm salute. They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the ``Nationalism`` movement, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party.`` They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin [URL] of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth [URL] that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome. They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at [URL] and at [URL] showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute [URL] is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (``Hakenkreuz`` in German). Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.`` Hitler altered his own signature [URL] to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika [URL] and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party [URL] by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand ``Nazi.`` Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no ``Nazi Party`` because it was actually the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party`` and the party members did not call themselves ``Nazis`` nor the ``Nazi Party.`` The term ``Nazi`` developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a ``Nazi`` too, in that the term means ``National Socialist.`` The term ``Nazi`` is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Wikipedia's liars use the term ``Nazi`` and the misnomer ``Nazi Party`` to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together [URL] as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, [URL] of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part. Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies [URL] of the media. [URL] Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic [URL] or who have lies to spread about the topic. The Wikipedia article for the ``Roman salute`` used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: ``The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute.

It is assumed throughout that the car is placed randomly, the players initial pick is random, and that the host always opens an unchosen door to reveal a goat. 1) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened door 3, is between 1/2 and 1 depending on the hosts door preference. (This is clearly a conditional probability) 2) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened door 2, is between 1/2 and 1 depending on the hosts door preference. (This is clearly a conditional probability) 3) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1 and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors, is 2/3 for all host preferences. (Morgan call this the unconditional case, maybe this is where the confusion arises). 4) The probability of winning by switching given that the player has picked a door and the host has opened one of the unchosen doors is 2/3 for all host preferences. 5) The probability of winning by switching on average for player who switch is 2/3 for all host preferences. :You're right. And notice that in case 3, opening one of the unchosen doors is not a condition, because it is part of the rules of the game. The only condition, if you would consider the full model, there is the initial picking of door 1. In case 4 there is no condition at all in the full model and hence it is the same as case 5. But ... notice that in the MHP a specific door has been chosen and a door opened. :::I continue here. The difficulty is what we do mean by probability. If you mean an average over all cases in which any door has been opened, there is, as I mentioned, no condition. If you mean: a door has been opened, but I do not know which one, and I want to average over all cases concerning the same door, the answer depends on the door and is a number between 1/2 and 1. ::::I do not quite agree with you. If we average over all cases where a door has been opened, but you do not know which one, the answer is 2/3 if we include all possible host strategies in our average. The only way to get an answer other than 2/3 is to average over cases where the host has a fixed strategy and the same door is opened every time. ::::Nijdam, do you see the connection with my simple problem in which a prize is placed behind one of two doors and the player then picks a door? If the player picks randomly the probability of winning is 1/2. If the player has picked just one specific door then the probability of winning depends on the initial prize placement. ::Who else agrees? :I agree with #1 and #2. I find #3, #4 and #5 somewhat ambiguous without further clarification, for example I don't know precisely what you mean by ``for all host preferences``. I would agree with the following revised versions: :::By 'for all host preferences' I mean regardless of whether the host policiy is to: always open door 2 where possible, always open door 3 where possible, choose randomly where there is a choice, or employ any other method of deciding which door to open within the stated rules. ::3) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked door 1, is 2/3. ::4) The probability of winning by switching, given that the player has picked a door, is 2/3. ::5) The probability of winning by switching on average for players who switch is 2/3. :These are clearly ``unconditional`` statements that say nothing about the player deciding after the",dev,False

We're all debating whether or not to mention the qualities of being homophobic or anti-homosexual in the lead paragraph. I can agree that ``homophobic`` might be misleading, as there's no evidence I can cite that proves he's actually AFRAID of gay people. However, there is mountains of evidence that he is against gays in general, the gay movement, the gay agenda, whatever. Let's face facts (not opinions, not passive observations, but facts). The man hasn't walked a step, spoken a word, inhaled or exhaled in the course of recorded history without firing off some quip about how homosexuals are damning the world and what have you. I think ``anti-homosexual`` is perfectly fitting in the lead paragraph. had a very good point when he (or she) wrote if someone is famous for something that many consider a negative attribute, we still have to indicate that. NPOV =/= hagiography. An example of this (and this is what I mean by this being brought up before) is the article for Adolf Hitler. The same condition applies here. Inarguably, he is ``famous for something that many consider a negative attribute``. The majority of people probably don't hold the guy to very high standards for his involvement with the Nazi party. Yet, this bit of information is listed in the lead sentence of his article. Being the most prominent Nazi in history is definitely considered BAD by the majority of people. Also, being the most prominent anti-homosexual in the world carries a mostly BAD vibe to it. So, why can we list Hitler's Nazism but not Phelps' anti-homosexualism(/ity/ness)? And, please don't simply direct me to NPOV. I think we've all read over that policy and are trying to come to some middleground that doesn't violate it, but also doesn't treat it like the Bible.

In Descartes, in Kant, in Hegel, in Husserl, in Wittgenstein’s Trac- tatus, and again in Wittgenstein’s Phil- osophical Investigations, one finds the same disgust at the spectacle of philosophers quarreling endlessly over the same issues. The proposed remedy for this situation typically consists in adopting a new method: for example, the method of “clear and distinct ideas” outlined in Descartes’ Regulae, Kant’s “transcendental method,” Husserl’s “bracketing,” the early Wittgen- stein’s attempt to exhibit the meaningless- ness of traditional philosophical theses by due attention to logical form, and the later Wittgenstein’s attempt to exhibit the point- lessness of these theses by diagnosing the causes of their having being propounded. In all of these revolts, the aim of the revo- lutionary is to replace opinion with knowl- edge, and to propose as the proper mean- ing of “philosophy” the accomplishment of some finite task by applying a certain set of mythological directions.

Just because Avatar seemingly rips off an obscure 70s book doesn't actually mean that anyone involved in the production has read it. An inspiration is a concession or formal acknowledgement that somebody's elses work influenced you. #If an author makes a claim that his work has been plagiarized, or indeed someone else makes such a claim, then it is potentially libellous if there is no legal validation. An accusation of plagiarism is an accusation of theft, and in unproven cases possibly defamatory. If someone's work has been plagiarised the rights holder always has the option to sue, and Wikipedia should only document such claims if there is comprehensive coverage though reliable sources. #If someone writes about similarities to other works then this is solely critical reception, and belongs in the appropriate section. They are stating their own personal view in regards to how it relates to other works. Like all critical reception, inclusion is based on the expertise of the person publishing the opinion, and the coverage of such a view. #You've read that obscure 70s book, and feel like it's your mission in life to let the world know what a rip-off merchant James Cameron is.

When it comes to Wikipedia itself all names should be used if NPOV was actually being observed... especially since the dispute is still ongoing. Many countries around the world still officially use FYROM (including even the US which still uses both names at times (the US Senate resolution last year condemning FYROM actually used the FYROM name). :What I really think is missing from the article is that technically speaking FYROM is currently in breach of at least a few of its original UN brokered terms with Greece. (This incidentally is exactly why I the why the US government passed the resolution last year condemning FYROM for breaking terms, why the Greek government vetoed FYROM's recent attempt at NATO membership, , and why it will probably veto EU membership as well.) :Agreement Violation #1: FYROM was supposed to stick to FYROM for external use :FYROM citizens are now trying to be recognized exclusively as ``Republic of Macedonia`` even though in Article 7 of the original UN brokered agreement (which their own leaders signed) specifically states ::``the Party of the First Part reserves the right to object to any membership referred to above if and to the extent of the Party of the Second Part is to be referred to in such organization or institution differently than in paragraph 2 of the United Nations Security Council resolution 817 (1993).

This means that on the whole there is no fixed ``right categorization`` but that it needs to be adjusted as items are added. At the moment the Category Caryophyllales contains lots of non-related items, and the exceptions belong to the family Cactaceae (in category Cacti, which looks to be allright) and a few genera only (Amaranthus, Drosera, Nepenthes) so at this moment it seems clearest to move these items into subcategories dedicated to each genus this has several advantages. As items are added it will be wise to look at it again and to add new subcategories. As I see it, at this moment this looks best. However I have not finished yet; a category should not contain that much over 150 items and Caryophyllales will be near the upper limit even after Nepenthes is properly filed away.

To avoid vicarious liability, an employer must demonstrate either that the employee was not negligent in that the employee was reasonably careful or that the employee was acting in his own right rather than on the employer's business. It can also be understood this way: When one person is liable for the negligent actions of another person, even though the first person was not directly responsible for the injury. For instance, a parent can be vicariously liable for the harmful acts of a child and an employer can be vicariously liable for the acts of a worker.

Either way, one of us is going to have to adapt. In this case, it's our British (and Commonwealth) cousins; in other cases, it's the Americans. It's not worth complaining about. :::Wikipedia:Manual of Style says, ``The English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national variety of the language. No variety is more correct than the others. Users are asked to take into account that the differences between the varieties are superficial.``, and says, ``When either of two styles is acceptable, it is inappropriate for an editor to change an article from one style to another unless there is a substantial reason to do so (for example, it is acceptable to change from American to British spelling if the article concerns a British topic).`` See also Wikipedia:Manual of Style (spelling). Feral Dogs Something about what is said about feral dogs in the article doesn't match with observations on feral dogs. Actually it doesn't even match with some articles in wikipedia. E.G. the Dingo is a feral dog too and they are excellent hunters, as well as the Carolina Dogs, who even seem to have some unique hunting skills. It's also wrong to assume that feral dog packs lack the social structure of wolf packs, you should browse for ``Tuscany Dog Project`` (thats a study concerning this topic) and the dogs there, although not completely feral, have a very complex social structure in their pack (check the german version of wikipedia if you like, there's a full article). Also wolves don't form packs on general, in Italy and in Germany as well many packs only consist of the parents, their current litter, and the litter of the last year. In Italy, there are many solitary wolves and many who only live in pairs, as well as quite a few packs of feral and semi-feral dogs who can hunt prey wolves aren't capable of and who are competing or interacting with wolves (depends on the situation). So all in all feral dogs aren't that poor. The dingo has had thousands of years to revert back to a semi-ativistic state. Domestic dogs havent had that amount of time to become fully fledged wild animals. While domestic dogs do form packs, there is little monogamy, cooperative hunting, or mutual puppy care. In all cases? If known cases of adoption, care for puppies by aunts (I admit, there is no prove for care by males), monogamy and cooperative hunting. As a matter of fact, these things aren't as common among wolves as most people think. Don't you think, you generalize to much? E.G. Erik Zimen (a famous cynologist in Europe) witnessed no monogamy in his poodle group. Observations by Eberhard Trummler and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas came to different results (the first observed dingo/wolf/dog-mixes and the latter Sibirian Huskies), as well as Guenther Bloch in his studies in Italy (two groups and one pack of near-feral dogs, mostly or entirely mongrels). You should keep in mind, that there isn't much data concerning this topic and it wouldn't be the first time that an observer didn't really observe and just judged by what he/she already thought to be true. Remember, for a long time people thought, that wolves would generally form packs with an alpha on the top and an omega on the bottom of the pack or that dogs would always search the nearness of humans, because ``they are born that way``. Both ``Facts`` have been proven to be wrong since at least the 80's, although they are still in the mind of many people. Laughter in dogs?

I also disputed the use of the term ``sharing,`` which is a misnomer. Sharing is a computer concept whereby a network of computers share access so that computer A can access a file on computer B, but the file remains resident on computer B. Copying is a simple concept whereby the file on computer B is copied to computer B. Napster was designed to facilitate copying, but the proponents of Napster called it ``sharing`` for propaganda purposes, since the unauthorized copying of a copyrighted work is a civil and criminal offense and morally wrong. ``Sharing`` sounds like something your elementary school teacher wanted you to do. If you share a sandwich, the other person eats half of your sandwich. If you log onto a so-called ``file-sharing`` system, the other person copies your song, but you keep your copy, too. The Courts held that Napster was a giant copyright infringement. However, it was very popular and still has many proponents on Widipedia, who still insist on calling it ``sharing`` and don't want the fact that their ``sharing`` wiped out the music industry (and a lot of recording arists with it), because that makes them immoral people.

I did not expect anyone to respond so quickly. My error. Since your contribution, I'll forgo editing and start anew to prevent confusion. You hit upon my major editing intent - to talk a bit about the blurred lines between categories. For instance, late Berlin is as easily categorized as House as New Music. In the case of Depeche Mode, they actually announced their intent to head into the club scene - thus we know it was a conscious decision. But as for the others such as The Cars, they simply progressed into a more mainstream sound over time. We actually agree on the major points you made. However, in my mind, there was more or less a definition of the genre that one could use at that particular time. For instance, in 1981 through 1983 the popular band Duran Duran was clearly New Wave. But I considered Sly Fox and Haircut 100 as also New Wave even though they were completely different. This despite the fact that I was not cognizent of what was on the producers minds at the time - we had no real internet with which to easily look up such things. The fact that the producers and I both agree on what was clearly the New Wave sound would be an astounding coincidence if it were just coincidence. But it is not coincidence - there was a definite sound to it, no matter how difficult it may be to clearly define it. Many of the bands attributed to New Wave were equally considered Punk or Pop. The Cars' first three albums could be considered both Pop and New Wave, but their Heartbeat City and subsequent albums saw them move away from the New Wave sound, or at least as I defined it circa 1981 when the genre hit it's stride (so to speak). We cannot define where the the edge of one genre ends and another picks up, but perhaps we can define the quintessential center of a genre at a particular time; knowing that the center will drift is some direction from year to year. Consider, my own preferences tended to drift towards the Pop side of the New Wave spectrum while someone else's preferences may drift towards the Punk or the Techo sides of New Wave. All the music could be considered part of the New Wave genre but all three of us could be listening to completely different bands. In a way, one could argue that New Wave put the three genre's together similarly to the way Fusion did with world music. Perhaps you are correct and I'm trying to define something that can never be clearly defined or agreed upon. As you can see, it being ``merely impossible`` did not stop me from trying, though.

Clinical, cosmetic and investigational dermatology CCID Dove Press Morgellons disease: Analysis of a population with clinically confirmed microscopic subcutaneous fibers of unknown etiology Virginia R Savely and Raphael B Stricker Additional article information Abstract Background: Morgellons disease is a controversial illness in which patients complain of stinging, burning, and biting sensations under the skin. Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding. The etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown, and diagnostic criteria have yet to be established. Our goal was to identify prevalent symptoms in patients with clinically confirmed subcutaneous fibers in order to develop a case definition for Morgellons disease. Methods: Patients with subcutaneous fibers observed on physical examination (designated as the fiber group) were evaluated using a data extraction tool that measured clinical and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of symptoms common to the fiber group was then compared with the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with Lyme disease and no complaints of skin fibers. Results: The fiber group consisted of 122 patients. Significant findings in this group were an association with tick-borne diseases and hypothyroidism, high numbers from two states (Texas and California), high prevalence in middle-aged Caucasian women, and an increased prevalence of smoking and substance abuse. Although depression was noted in 29% of the fiber patients, pre-existing delusional disease was not reported. After adjusting for nonspecific symptoms, the most common symptoms reported in the fiber group were: crawling sensations under the skin; spontaneously appearing, slow-healing lesions; hyperpigmented scars when lesions heal; intense pruritus; seed-like objects, black specks, or “fuzz balls” in lesions or on intact skin; fine, thread-like fibers of varying colors in lesions and intact skin; lesions containing thick, tough, translucent fibers that are highly resistant to extraction; and a sensation of something trying to penetrate the skin from the inside out. Conclusions: This study of the largest clinical cohort reported to date provides the basis for an accurate and clinically useful case definition for Morgellons disease. Keywords: Morgellons, subcutaneous fibers, pruritus, delusions of parasitosis, Lyme disease, skin lesions Introduction Morgellons disease is a poorly understood multisystem illness characterized by stinging, biting, and crawling sensations under the skin.1 According to the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) website, more than 14,000 families are reportedly affected by this emerging disease.2 Considerable suffering occurs as thread-like fibers work their way out of the victim’s skin causing pain, itching, and open, disfiguring lesions (Figures 1 and ​and2).2). Unfortunately, patients are often dismissed as delusional by clinicians who are unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of Morgellons disease.3–5 There is a scarcity of literature on Morgellons disease due to its relatively recent description in the modern medical literature, the reluctance on the part of the medical community to recognize it as anything other than psychopathology, and the lack of knowledge about its etiology and transmission.6 Figure 1 Morgellons patient’s lower legs. Similar lesions covered her trunk and arms. There were no excoriations or secondary infections. Photo courtesy of Cindy Casey, Charles E Holman Foundation, Austin, Texas. Reproduced with permission. Figure 2 Morgellons patient’s back. Note that lesions and scars occur in areas that could not have been reached by the patient. Photo courtesy of Cindy Casey, Charles E Holman Foundation, Austin, Texas. Reproduced with permission. The distinctive feature of Morgellons disease is the presence of microscopic subcutaneous fibers1 (Figures 3, ​,4,4, and ​and5).5). Observation of the skin with a lighted, hand-held, 30 × to 60 × magnifier enables visualization of these red, blue, black, and white fibers that have the appearance of either straight hollow tubes or wiry tangled threads.1 At times the fibers are seen above the dermis as loosely clumped “fuzz balls” or as black specks the size of coffee grains. Examination of the black specks by electron microscopy reveals that they consist of a tightly woven ball of black fibers.6 Figure 3 Close up of a leg lesion showing a twisted fiber just under the epidermis.

Human rights organisations in India, the US and Europe implicated two organisations in the well-orchestrated attacks, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP or World Hindu Council) and its youth offshoot, the Bajrang Dal (devotees of the monkey-god Hanuman). Now a Financial Times investigation has established that these groups receive extensive funding from Indians abroad, collected mainly as tax-free charity donations to front organisations in the US and the UK. This fundraising is coming under increasing scrutiny. So it should - as should the links between these groups and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). Behind the VHP and the Bajrang Dal stands a quasi-paramilitary body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or Association of National Volunteers), which is the mother organisation of the Hindu revivalist BJP. Described by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, as ``an Indian version of fascism``, the RSS is at the centre of a protean network of front organisations. This structure facilitates arm's-length money-raising. It also makes it easier for the RSS to deny it is inciting agitation against Muslims and Christians.....................................The RSS spends heavily on welfare and religious schools, but so do Islamist groups in the Muslim world - a danger the world has woken up to. Such ostensibly charitable activities are one reason for the groups' success. They also help pull in donations from people unaware of how some of their money is used. The UK is formally investigating two RSS fundraising affiliates, and is considering an inquiry into the VHP. The US has also started carefully scrutinising RSS front organisations. That probe should go ahead unimpeded by Washington's ambition to develop a strategic alliance with India as a counterbalance to China's weight in Asia.

18281,40916540,"` Purges in the Red Army The late 1930s saw the so-called ``Purges of the Red Army cadres``, occurring against the historical background of the Great Purge. The Purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of the ``politically unreliable element``, mainly among the higher-ranking officers. This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for settling personal vendettas and eventually resulted in a witch hunt. Some observers believe that the Purges weakened the Red Army considerably, but this remains a hotly debated subject. Many commentators overlook the fact that the Red Army grew significantly in numbers during the peak of the Purges. In 1937, the Red Army numbered around 1.3 million, and it grew to almost three times that number by June 1941. This necessitated quick promotion of junior officers, often despite their lack of experience or training, with obvious grave implications. In another important consideration, by the end of the Purges the pendulum swung back, restoring and promoting many of the purged officers. Recently declassified data indicate that in 1937, during the culmination of the Purges, the Red Army had 114,300 officers, of whom 11,034 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940. Yet, in 1938, the Red Army had 179,000 officers (56% more compared to 1937), of whom a further 6,742 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940 In the highest echelons of the Red Army the Purges removed 3 of 5 marshals, 13 of 15 army generals, 8 of 9 admirals, 50 of 57 army corps generals, 154 out of 186 division generals, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.

I think it is of the outmost importance to place references to living chiefs, especially if good third party references list another as chief. As you can no doubt guess, chiefs are often subject to vandalism and it best for all concerned that they are properly referenced, by name, title and designation. The problem with the change of chief is that Burk's and the Standing Council are not updating their sites. The only good reference is the highlander magazine, and this updates only once a year (and only has what information it is given).

In 1991 the first media reports about the three Free Advice Ladies began to appear. Why? Because, unbeknownst to the general public, Amy Alkon and her two colleagues Minnick and Johnson, had read the article in The New Yorker and figured they could make it appear to be their own original idea. Nothing could be further from the truth. The evidence exists at The Official Free Advice Man Web-site.When the original Free Advice Man went back up to New York from Baltimore, where he was residing at the time, and confronted the three intellectual thieves, he asked them, without first divulging his own respective identity, where they had come up with the idea. Because they were not under the spotlight of a major mass media outlet they divulged the truth: ``...we read this article in The New Yorker and thought that this would be fun to do...``.

4636,267293177,"` The very concept of ``discrete mathematics`` itself is a vague illusion The thing is, analysis is like anything else in mathematics. It can be built up from the basic principles of counting. That is, the simplest principles that build the addition function, which we think of as the number of elements in a union of finite disjoint sets of given sizes, and the multiplication function, the exponentiation function, etc, and anything required for general talk of ``the`` number of objects corresponding to some act of counting, that is, to prove that it is well defined. These basic counting principles are responsible for all of mathematics, including analysis. There is only one mathematics. There is no distinction between discrete and continuous mathematics that is not exposed as an illusion if you look hard enough. There are no walls. It's fine to think about discrete mathematics in the same sort of loose way that people think about the distinction between number theory and combinatorics. For example, the Goldbach conjecture is easily stated combinatorially, and that's fine as long as you recognise the inherent looseness in what these two areas of mathematics represent. An article about ``discrete mathematics`` can never be very good. All it can say, is that discrete mathematics is a hodgepodge of areas of mathematics which do not implictly involve the areas of real or complex analysis, or topology, for their study.

Because, it has so many mistakes that no publisher could have handled it. The photos are all false, and not a single picture was an evidence of the ‘Nanking Massacre.’ Not only that, her description about Japanese history is filled with absurd mistakes. For instance, she wrote that the Japanese military strength before the end of the Edo era (1603 -1867) had not exceeded the level of sword, bow and arrow (in fact, Japan was the biggest producer of guns in the world already in the 16th century). More than 100 such rudimentary mistakes were found in the book, and even if the book is published in Japan, no Japanese people could bear reading it. A left-wing publishing company tried to publish it with notes annotated by translator, but she refused it saying, “How impertinent.” Sad to say, the Americans trust such a book and are making movies.” Shoichi Watanabe, a professor emeritus of Jochi University, mentioned, “Before World War II, a false document called the Tanaka Memorial was made in China. This was a purported Japanese strategic planning document from 1927, in which Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka laid out for Emperor Hirohito a strategy to take over the world. The American President Roosevelt, senators and congressmen read this forgery, and believed the lie that Japan had a malicious intention to take over Asia and the world. That became a cause for the US-Japan war. It is said that after reading it, Roosevelt decided to defeat Japan entirely. Iris Chang’s ‘The Rape of Nanking’ is the same.

22157,595845967,"` This block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop. I went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a ``diatribe``; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to ``justify`` my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable. The very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as ``diatribe``, an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation. If article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.( )`",dev,False

I'm not too addicted to improving articles anymore, though I still do that too, but my main concerns at Wikipedia these days are vandalism, deceptive edits (which falls under vandalism), messiness, and inaccuracy (which may or may not fall under vandalism). Your take on the the Heterosexualization article, an article I don't remember being involved in until now, would be beneficial and relevant, I believe. This is not a long, dragged-out dogfight, and I have made it clear to the editor that I am not going to sit there and debate his Westerner-objections for hours on end. My complaint is not a matter of debate, I feel. My complaint is his habit of not playing by Wikipedia's guidelines/rules. I advised him to do that. I am not interested in getting into a debate with him, because he believes what he believes and it affects everything he does in regards to editing LGBT topics at Wikipedia. You say, ``...WP is an encyclopedia; the task here is to present not our personal feelings and views, but what reliable, expert sources have said...`` I'm saying this editor most often doesn't go by that. :I asked others to weigh in because otherwise...nothing is going to get resolved. As I stated on your talk page, ``I posted a message about it at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject LGBT studies, which you may have seen already, but I hardly get any help from there or from other WikiProjects these days. So part of my approach these days is to go to relevant editors individually and hope they weigh in.`` I'm not sure what is going on with people not helping out at Wikipedia anymore and ignoring requests for opinions to resolve disputes/and or how to make improvements, but it is extremely annoying and is making me want to quit Wikipedia even more. I don't understand this ``Leave them to it`` attitude that has been going around lately. I mean, I understand it in cases such as yours, but it seems almost everyone here is doing it now (being lazy or otherwise disinterested) when editors genuinely need help to resolve issues at an article.

I rarely participate in discussions. I am an administrator - one of the first ever appointed - but I rarely exercise my admin rights. I generally try to avoid many of the petty disputes that the admins regularly get themselves caught up in. In the off-chance that anyone cares about my opinion: I am very disturbed by the trend to championing ``process`` over ``quality`` which has become a hallmark of the 'pedia's internal wrangling. It's heartbreaking, and is the reason why so many good people have left the project. As a result, I just stick to writing content whenever I find the time.`` Roddy Young. PS looking at the copyright laws I feel that delete and rvt others work may be argued as superceeding the persons copyright entitlement. It that is the case and upset was had due to deletes and a law suit could be taken over other deleting work this would raise some interesting changes to the culture of wikipedia and may even be the end of it as we know. I must admit that attention is agained when someone deletes a bit of work. If deleting stopped then wikipedia would become flabby. Jeff3000 I invite you to take the new understanding that you have gained and present a case to the policy committee. Why? Because that would atone for you deleting work and rvt work that was never authored in the first place. I have to talk this out to concensus before I go back to the page to add material to the main page. So those people that ask to leave the matter and move on miss the point that deletes are at the heart of the matter. What is at the heart of this matter is the following text ``Baha'i content has made its way on to www.youtube.com website. With over 100 million video downloads each day and 20 million users per month on Youtube this website is a growing forum for Baha'i Holy Day commemorations and other Baha'i content in audio visual material. The earliest video upload was added September 25, 2005, ``Baha'i wedding``. The next oldest video upload was added October 20, 2005, ``Aniversário do Bab / Bab's Birthday``. As of 21 August 2006 there is 113 video uploads that have the tags ``Baha'i`` that is picked up in a Youtube search. Aniversário do Bab / Bab's Birthday has 158 views in 10 months and Baha'i wedding has 1,185 views.`` Now when I last read Nibil's Narrative, the book on the early history of the Babis, 1844-1850 heroic era, I was impressed. This book only needs a link and a reference on the main Baha'i page because we would expect a person to get the book out and read it. Space is saved on the main page. However I do see the youtube content as a contempory addition to the Main pages that requires a few lines. These lines make the first notes of the present day ``contempory Nibil's Narrative``. Age and era of forfilment is now. The heroic era is over and closed. It makes good encyclopedic material. However the real time ``heroic material`` is real time. It is happening all around the world, ruhi books, childrens classes, devotional meetings and junior youth. When activities inspired by these efforts are reported on Youtube then that becomes material for the modern day ``contempory Nibil's Narrative``. ``Baha'i content hasmade its way on to www.yoube.com website.`` Is a true statement. ``With over 100 million video downloads each day and 20 million users per month on Youtube...`` makes the fact notable my greatest numbers - unconscious concensus. ``...Baha'i Holy days and commemorations...`` is very much Baha'i page content. People gathering today around the world to remember the 23 May 1844 at a Holy day and recording a video and uploading it on Youtube now lets me look at other languages and cultures doing the same as I. ``The earliest video uploadwas added September 23, 2005...`` this fact is true. The link to the video is the reference method open to verification. Jeff3000 do you consider delete as an infringement of my copyright by superceeding. If so I agree that talk needs to happen first in the talk page before moving to the main page. You have my commitment to that.

11199,643030819,"` ::::::::: Not quite. The first step is to figure out how copyright and free licensing works. :::::::::For the most part, every creative work that anyone creates (in the U.S. and most other countries) is automatically copyrighted. This can include artwork, graphics, music, etc. Copyright means what it sounds like - the ``right to copy``, and that lies with the author of the image. :::::::::Now, you can't simply use another person's copyrighted work without their permission (sure, you can put together a graphic and post it on reddit and nothing will likely happen - we're talking from a technical and legal point of view, though). If I make a painting, and you take that painting and stick it on a shirt and sell it without my permission, I could potentially take you to court. :::::::::There is an exception to this, called ``fair use`` in the United States (and ``fair dealing`` in some other places). Since Wikimedia is based in the U.S., we'll look at it from a U.S. perspective: fair usage allows you to use a copyrighted work, without permission, with the following factors taken into consideration: ::::::::: * The purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes ::::::::: * The nature of the copyrighted work ::::::::: * The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole ::::::::: * The effect of the use upon the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work :::::::::It's a case by case basis, but fair use allows, for example, Wikipedia to display short samples of songs in its articles, or a low-resolution picture of Mario in the Mario article, all without permission. But fair use is a whole other topic - back to copyright. :::::::::This is where the free license movement and the Creative Commons step in. The Creative Commons are a suite of licenses that allow authors to license their works in a way that allow anyone to use them, as long as the original author is attributed. There are other optional limitations, such as not allowing people to use your work for commercial purposes, or requiring anyone that uses your work to license their derivative under a similar license. The Wikimedia Commons is a host of free media, for anyone to use for any purpose (including commercial). This ``free license movement`` has lead to hundreds of millions of works being made available for all to use freely, often for educational purposes. For example, I myself have seen a couple of my freely licensed images appear in news articles or educational publications - it's a nice thing to contribute to. :::::::::So, this hopefully answers your question about whether or not you can create a work for the Commons that is composed of other images. You can, as long as the images you are using are also freely licensed. Remember, the point of free licenses is the let people to use works for their own purposes without seeking permission. If the images are copyrighted (or show no sign of free licensing), you don't have the right to copy the work to use in your own work. And yes, you should cite the sources of all the works that go into your own, even if they're in the public domain - claiming them as your own work is plagiarism.

LOGIC, which is what ANY serious educational or informational service has to eventually use, is the only solution to your problems. Logic ends most of the tools used by pack psychology, ends psychological warfare tactics, exposes ignorance and lies and misinformation, as well as bad reasoning, and levels the playing feild enough so that an Expert has a chance to actually confront that mob.

It will be better for you, and for everybody concerned, if you adress the problems, and work with those who are capable of being lucid relevant to those problems to solve those problems. Unless your goal is to have entropy and pack psychology dominate the world, and to be yet one more example of how politics and pack psychology enforce intentional ignorance and doublethink propagandas. Lets start with square one. Knowledgable experts ought to be able to as much as float an outline on a talk page without having it deleted by pov warriors whos agenda is to keep the conversation in drama. People who are seriously abused by others ought to have realistic and swift recourse regarding that abuse. People should not be allowed to stack RFCs with their freinds. People should not be allowed to stack votes for deletion with their freinds. People should not be allowed to attack others and then cite them for personal attacks if they as much as respond with a simple mirrored reflection of the original attack. Pov warriors should not have pet rogue admins blocking people on trumped up charges to silence them for making noise about serious abuses. Wikipedia should not be psychological combat. And Yet, it is. Since it vanished into the ethers, lets recap the more angry and to the point message you failed to answer. - Wikipedia IS evil [23] It is host to the same big political groupthink game that goes on in all of the rest of civilization. It is a battleground for propaganda warfare, a lawless game in which anything can be said as long as its in ``neutral`` language even if its a propagandists lie, and even if it exists only to dispute a known fact. It is a place notable mostly for what it conspicuously lacks. There are in general thousands of articles which tell us about as much as a High Schooler might, and which then devolve into factoids and rhetoric. The expertise of depth knowledge is missing. No expert would submit themselves to a situation of patent pack psychology informational riot. Wikipedia is Evil. And You, Jimbo Wales, are the guy who created it. Maybe you should try some Formal Logic in the mix. Maybe this ``Randian`` Environment could use some controls on its chaos vectors. Maybe even a realistic and functional methodology for dealing with abuse might be in order. Nice graphic box at the top of the page says to go post at the admin desk,. Funny, i tried that, and got less than no result. Abusiveness is rampant and the organization is headless. I can tell Wikipedia in fifty places what its problems are and how to solve them, but wikipedias nose is in the air, and the God king doesn't seem to read his talk page. What you have here isn't an encyclopedia, and in pretending, all that it offers a legitamate participant over the long term is abuse. The admin desk won't help you if you are being attacked and baited with ad hominems; they don't even know what one is. They aren't required to pick up any education to become admins; they come with the standard prole ``opinion`` fully intact, and no knowledge to back anything up. Good luck with your evil science social sciences project. Let me know if you want any help to fix it. Prometheuspan Larry Sanger has the same diagnosis that i do. I have more to offer in terms of how to solve the problem. But not whilst being blocked by trolls and their pet admins for making the effort. ``Wikipedia has, to its credit, done something about the most serious trolling and other kinds of abuse: there is an Arbitration Committee that provides a process whereby the most disruptive users of Wikipedia can be ejected from the project. But there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation, let alone arbitration. A few of the project's participants can be, not to put a nice word on it, pretty nasty. And this is tolerated. So, for any person who can and wants to work politely with well-meaning, rational, reasonably well-informed peoplewhich is to say, to be sure, most people working on Wikipediathe constant fighting can be so off-putting as to drive them away from the project. This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) I need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. Consequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to ``work with`` persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). This lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. This lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively an",dev,False

John has a casting vote in the event that there should ever be a tie in voting in the Dail, as nearly happened last week during a vote on Aer Lingus in Shannon which the gov won only by one vote, should that or any other vote be a tie John would have to cast his deciding vote which would most likely favour Fianna Fail. John will in theory remain a TD until 2017 providing he lives that long and that this current gov and the next government of 2012 goes full term. It was a stroke of genius by Bertie to nominate John as Ceann Comhairle as it will guarantee him his seat in the hotly contested South Kerry constituency which may merge with Kerry North to form a five seater representing all County Kerry. John is guaranteed his seat and it may eventually rid Fianna Fáil of the Healy-Rae Dynasty as Jackie (Highly Unlikey) or his son Michael would then be under pressure to retain the Healy-Rae seat in face of massive pressure from either Tom Fleming (unlikely) or Mark Daly (most likely) in a five seater the Healy Rae's would gather votes in North Kerry but either way they would be under pressure. If the South Kerry constituency is kept they would have virtually no hope because if Mark Daly who is from Kenmare runs he would erode the Healy-Rae home vote in Kilgarvan which is only 10kms from Kenmare as has close ties with the town. Coupled to this Mark Daly is a well liked auctioneer and a TV presenter with RTÉ and appeared on the RTE's Reality TV show Treasure Island in 2002. Mark Daly would gather a huge lot of John O'Donoghue's traditional votes and and the other Fianna Fail votes which went to Tom Fleming who out polled Jackie Healy-Rae twice but lost on transfers from FG and Lab.

Secondly, the subtitles need to be renamed/reorganized, and some material needs to be shifted into different categories. The entire ``cultural background`` subsection is Christian POV and should be named as such.

You stated that it shouldn't be difficult for it to become a GA. Does that mean it's ready to become a GA, or it still needs some work? If it does, which particular parts need to be improved? Thanks. csdnew Mami Kawada Hello Knowledgekid87. I hope you know a lot about BLPs, because I would really need your advice about one of them. You see, the Japanese singer Mami Kawada, who sings songs for anime like Shakugan no Shana and Toaru Majutsu no Index, is my favorite singer, but unfortunately her article is merely a Start-class article with a big BLP-refimprove tag at the top. I wish I could improve the article more, but there are relatively few known details about her early life. What is known is that she is from Sapporo, she was born on February 13 on a year that I estimate is between 1977 and 1981, her blood type is O, and that she was discovered by Eiko Shimamiya at the latter's vocal school. I need advice on the following parts: 1. What parts in her article need to be trimmed or expanded? Is there a better way to organize all the information? Do her collaborations with Kotoko Horikawa KOTOKO (yes I'm aware that Horikawa is probably not her last name) even need to be elaborated? 2. Can her official site be used as a source for certain information? If so, for which ones? 3. Are there good reliable Japanese sites which I can use as a source? You advice would be truly appreciated. Thank you. csdnew Syrian Uprising Thanks for your cool-headed intervention at the right time and in the right manner, we have now avoided a huge blunder and war between editors. I am also very satisfied with the outcome and reverting to the very accurate title Syrian uprising (2011–present) rather than ``civil war`` that did have majority voting in discussions but was erroneously based on subjective look into things rather than the international media that continuously refers to it as an uprising. My firm conviction that even majority votes on talk pages should not be binding. I nominate that this discussion becomes a precedence to other talk pages where we don't automatically follow majorities but we rely basically on reliable and objective outside sources. Talk page votes may be taken into some consideration, but should never be the basis of final decision. I also applaud colleague Tradedia whose attentive following and vehement opposition and putting to my attention about the premature move to ``Civil War`` did give its results. Again thanks for you for your patience. :The article SHOULD be protected from arbitrary moves for quite a while. We didn't discuss all this for somebody to come and change it just for ideology or for plain egoism. Is there a way of making it absolutely protected for a considerable period? It's well worth it. Of course if and when it becomes a civil war, a responsible administrator can always make the move himself. No need for just any editor to do that. Inform me if there is a good way of achieving this so that we don't make mockery of the concensus process. Disambiguation link notification for June 28 Hi.

Thanks, Cons Hi, I'm glad you could expand on Anime Festival Orlando; I really didn't feel with my searches for information that it would be possible to establish notability, and I'm still concerned even with the additions. The Ohayocon article is in similar need of help if you have some time, I can’t expand it any further with how I construct articles. Anime Mid-Atlantic is the main reason I’m contacting you, there’s a huge mess in there, details here: . Sadly, the dispute over the attendance figures can now be resolved because AnimeCons.com has been updated with said numbers, but an administrator came in and deleted the event history table with the reasoning “verified or not (and not all these sources are reliable), this does not seem like encyclopedic information at allthis may be of relevance to the club, but not to the world at large (esp. the lists of non-notables.” I can’t agree with their reasoning as the information was properly sourced, from a source that’s generally accepted within convention articles as accurate. I’m not sure how to approach the issue and would appreciate your help, as I’m worried if these edits stand it could cause great problems for editing convention articles in the future. : The problem I feel with any kind of phase out is that not all cons release information when guests cancel, or guests change, and it will lead to severe reliability issues. Animecons.com does require sources for when an update is put up, which I feel enhances their reliability. I also have to raise the point that most of the ANN pieces are press releases about cons and are just reprints of what the cons send.

Everyone is discussing AIM's side and the role of the government in the incident but no one is putting in the view points of the actual residents of South Dakota. I am not native but many of my friends and family are. I see AIM in the same way as I assume many people in a variety of countries see their uprising residents on the national news. The citizens screaming and calling for justice may not be speaking for the population as a whole; but they are the ones that make the news. I think before you guys make opinions based on what the media tells you; you should find out if the average tribal member agrees with Russel Means or Leonard Peltier. You should also research how much time they actually spent on the reservation. Again I am no expert but from what I know growing up here is that AIM and many others like them were extreme liberals that were not necessarily speaking for the society at large. I just feel that this is similiar as basing views of the Muslim world based on the extremest you see on TV. I would like to see someone who actually was a neutral member of the Lakota tribe that grew up here to set us all straight and until then to take both sides with a grain of salt.

They are: *``The adoption of the GRC scheme in 1988 therefore represented a significant shift in thinking from the views of the Constitutional Commission.`` *``This is usually done a few months before a general election is called.`` *``For the 2011 general election, there were 12 SMCs and 15 GRCs.`` *``On 27 May 2009, the Government announced that it would refine the size and number of GRCs. This could be achieved without amending either the Constitution or the Parliamentary Elections Act. Instead, when the next EBRC was appointed, its terms of reference would instruct the Committee to plan for fewer six-member GRCs than at present, and to reduce the average size of each GRC. The average size of GRCs at that time was 5.4 MPs because there were only five-member and six-member GRCs. The new average, however, would not exceed five MPs. *``In the 2011 general election, SMCs returned to Parliament 12 MPs and 15 GRCs a total of 75 MPs.`` *``As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the presence of minority MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests of minority communities are represented in Parliament. In this way, the democratic ideal of equality is achieved by ensuring that all races are accorded Parliamentary representation.`` *``As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, and the fact that there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.`` *``Improving the link between voters and MPs, and to make the latter more accountable was the reason for the changes proposed in 2009 to introduce more SMCs and to reduce the size of GRCs.`` On this page: , it notes that a few of the URL's for the references have a ``connection issue``.

I receive money from 4 different entities (none of whom care a fig about Hansen, for what it's worth), but I'm not allowed to consider their interests in editing Wikipedia or in the other collaborative projects I participate in. If you are unable to separate the importance of Hansen's message from the importance of placing only what Hansen says or what is said about his message by reliable sources, only in articles related to that message (or, to be precise, only in articles to which that message is relevant), then, as a matter of conscience, you shouldn't be editing Wikipedia. :As for some of your specifics, if the precise meaning isn't clear, we Wikipedians are not allowed to interpret his words. He never said ``biosequestration`` (and we don't seem to have an article on geosequestration); ``proportional`` is false (and hence shouldn't be in the articles unless he explicitly said it); ``inversely proportional`` is less false, but still not accurate, and not the clear meaning of what he said; and his comments on Kyoto are really about his interpretation of the consequences of Kyoto, and should be treated as such. Kyoto (would have) set national goals, but didn't specify the mechanisms of attainment; Hansen's interpretation that it encourage(d) cap and trade is an interpretation, and should also have been treated as such, even if his opinions were notable. :Your points (1) and (2) above are correct, but that doesn't explain why you didn't say it like that or add it to an article on sequestration, or coal power plants, rather than on biosequestration and Kyoto. :My real identity is easy enough to determine from the article written about me, as is WMC's from the article written about him.

20041,450665857,"` Advice on uploading images Hello! Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia. I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images. *Pick an image name. :When uploading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique. Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive. *Source the image. :On the image description page, explain where the image came from. If you created the image yourself, then say so. If it's from the web, give a URL. If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title. *Provide copyright and license information. :This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important. The copyright of the image generally belongs to whoever created it. ::If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you hold the copyright. To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.) Do this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{PD-self}}. Be sure to mention that you created the image. If you're using {{PD-self}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain. ::If you didn't create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might ``create``, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image. Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content. This means that images cannot have a restriction such as ``only for use by Wikipedia``, or ``for non-commercial use only``, or ``for educational use``. Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under our policy for non-free content, but such a use must be justified on the image description page. *Describe the image. :To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood. A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page. Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article. Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: Copyrights, Copyright tags, Non-free content, Image description page, Public domain, Images for deletion, Possibly unfree images, Copyright problems, Uploading images Thanks again for your contributions.

The term ``legal adviser`` in rule 2 must embrace any lawyer who (a) is chosen by the prisoner, and (b) is entitled to represent the prisoner in criminal proceedings to which the prisoner is a defendant. On the evidence before the court, Mr Di Stefano is an Italian avvocato who falls within the definition of ``EEC lawyer`` in the 1978 Order. He has been chosen by the claimant to represent him in ongoing criminal proceedings. It therefore follows that Mr Di Stefano falls within the term ``his solicitor or counsel`` in rule 2 of the Prison Rules. 41. Under rule 38(1) Mr Di Stefano must be afforded reasonable facilities for interviewing his client in Belmarsh Prison in connection with the current criminal proceedings. MR JUSTICE JACKSON: Thank you. The claimant has won on the grounds set out in his claim form. The claimant has won on the live issues before the court. The proper order in all the circumstances of this case is that costs should follow the event. The defendant must pay the claimant's costs of the judicial review proceedings. Van Hoogstraten, Re [2002] EWHC 2015 Admin Jackson J Case No: CO/4302/2002 Date: 26/09/2002 10. The argument which Mr Johnson deployed at the hearing last week was to the following effect: An Italian avvocato is not a solicitor or a barrister; therefore he is not one of those persons entitled under Rule 38 of the Prison Rules 1999 to make a legal visit to Mr Van Hoogstraten in Belmarsh Prison. There was before the court last week evidence that Mr Di Stefano is an Italian avvocato. There are a number of references to this in the documentation before me. Perhaps most pertinently the bundle at page 67 includes Mr Di Stefano's identification card and halfway down we see: ``Professione Avvocato``. On the right of that there is a photograph of Mr Di Stefano and his signature. 11. There was no reservation by the defendant to the effect that Mr Di Stefano was not an avvocato at all. Argument proceeded last week on the question whether or not an Italian avvocato fell within rule 2(1) and rule 38(1) of the Prison Rules. 17. It should be borne in mind that Mr Di Stefano is the lawyer who has been chosen by the claimant to represent him in criminal proceedings. He has been chosen as the lead lawyer to represent the claimant, and under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights the claimant is entitled to be represented by the lawyer of his choice. That must entail the opportunity to confer with the lawyer of his choice before he appears for sentence. 25. Mr Di Stefano has been appointed as the principal legal adviser of the claimant. It seems to me that Mr Di Stefano has exercised wise judgment in the legal team which he has appointed. He has selected as one of the Leading Counsel to make the plea in mitigation a leading authority in the field of criminal sentencing. Mr Tam submits that with such a distinguished legal team it is quite unnecessary for Mr Di Stefano to visit his client in prison. He can receive instructions at secondhand, and Article 6 does not require Mr Di Stefano's presence. 26. I do not agree. Mr Van Hoogstraten has chosen Mr Di Stefano as his principal legal adviser. The choice of principal legal adviser is for the client. It is not for me; it is not for counsel in this case or anybody else. It is a matter for the client, and if he wishes to appoint an Italian avvocato as his principal legal adviser, and that Italian avvocato has rights to practise in this country under the 1978 Order, then Mr Van Hoogstraten is entitled to take that course. Van Hoogstraten, Re [2002] EWHC 2015 Admin Jackson J And more important the concession made by the Home Office 71. If your Lordship then goes on to page 61, your Lordship will see the letter written to the Central Criminal Court. In the second paragraph of that the letter is said to enclose the documentation referred to therein, including the Power of Attorney and the Certificate that he has as to his good standing as an avvocato in Italy. Then in the fourth paragraph, the identification card which describes him as an avvocato. 72. Now, it appears that the certificates on 64, 65 and 66 are the certificates referred to, but as your Lordship will recall I think a concession was made last week that those certificates are in fact of good character in terms of criminal convictions and charges and do not relate to his status as an avvocato. And then the identification card on 67 itself describes him as “avvocato``. One does not know which of the two ambiguous meanings that might have. 73. MR JUSTICE JACKSON: Woul",dev,False

7595,561579109,"` My letter to NeinN I am not NeilN's psychiatrist, and, as I haven’t examined NeilN, I won’t diagnose him. But because NeilN has turned himself into a public laboratory of psychopathology, I want to talk about how I'd give direction to a universal human development of culture, ethics, and morality. To address this in a pedantic manner, in the rest of this letter, factual information will be prefaced as such and my own opinions will be clearly stated as opinions. For instance, it is a fact that people used to think I was exaggerating whenever I said that like other volage-brained sensualists, he has a finely honed ability to welsh on all types of agreements. After seeing NeilN precipitate riots these same people now realize that I wasn't exaggerating at all. In fact, they even realize that when a friend wants to drive inebriated, you try to stop him. Well, NeilN is drunk with power, which is why we must drive off and disperse the obdurate bohemians who manufacture outrage at his castigators by attributing to them all sorts of uppity fairy tales. If the only way to stop the Huns at the gate is for me to fall prey to NeilN's rhetoric and obfuscation, then so be it. It would sincerely be worth it because he had promised us liberty, equality, and fraternity. Instead, NeilN gave us sensationalism, propagandism, and officialism. I suppose we should have seen that coming, especially since NeilN claims to be supportive of my plan to confront and reject all manifestations of feudalism. Don't trust him, though; he's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Before you know it, he'll treat traditional values as if they were rapacious crimes. Not only that, but some benighted bloodsuckers are actually considering helping NeilN cause one-sided inclinations to be entered into historical fact. How quickly such people forget that they were lied to, made fun of, and ridiculed by NeilN on numerous occasions. It's scary how effectively NeilN has been making a mockery of the term ``disproportionableness``. I deeply regret the loss of life and injuries sustained by this tragedy. I am currently working to understand the surrounding circumstances so as to improve our ability to plant markers that define the limits of what is untoward and what is not. We have a dilemma of leviathan proportions on our hands: Should we strip the unjust power from those who seek power over others and over nature, or is it sufficient to put him in his place? In answer to that question I submit—and millions of people in this country and abroad unmistakably agree with me—that Bourbonism has served as the justification for the butchering, torture, and enslavement of more people than any other ``ism``. That's why it's NeilN's favorite; it makes it easy for him to mute the voice of anyone who dares to speak out against him. You might think this is all pretty funny now, but I doubt I'll hear you laughing if, faster than you can say ``floccinaucinihilipilification``, NeilN is successfully able to use paid informants and provocateurs to make higher education accessible only to those in the higher echelons of society. I've heard numerous complaints about his behavior. Many people I've talked to have complained that NeilN comports himself like a filthy pig, heedless of all needs but his own. Among these needs the paramount one seems to be the need to burn books. This backs up my point that he likes saying that better governance can be achieved by granting profitable concessions, permits, waivers, zoning variances, monopolies, and other such political machinations to his band. Okay, that's a parody—but not a very gross one. In point of fact, NeilN is extremely mawkish. In fact, my handy-dandy Mawkish-O-Meter confirms that prudence is no vice. Cowardice—especially NeilN's deplorable form of it—is. Now that you've read the bulk of this letter, it should not come as a complete surprise that some of the things NeilN says and some of the things he stands for are so feckless, it hurts to think about them. However, this fact bears repeating again and again, until the words crack through the hardened exteriors of those who would make a big deal out of nothing. I am referring, of course, to the likes of NeilN. `",dev,False

This page is sourced and is done by someone with a Ph. D. Also the reality of the existence of in particular the Iraqi government advertisements of December 11, 1975 (calling for any Iraqi Jews to come back to Iraq) is admitted even by ideologically Zionist website [www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/discredit.html] which state that pro-Zionist groups ``scoffed at`` the Iraqi offer.

D.), especially if writings of the ``JCPA`` is included as the JCPA is an obviously partisan think-tank associated with the Israeli Likud party in particular (so any noting of the legitimate sources I'm providing, putting aside the pro-Zionist source corroborating in particular the 1975 Iraqi government advertisements, being partisan to one side should also then have the ``JCPA`` links and writings removed for partisan reasons). This info should be included in the ``compensation`` section as it by itself (the offer, whether one believes it or things like it are genuine or not) would be an offer of not just ``compensation`` but a return to where one originally came from in the first place.

If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the Main Page. If you prefer that the article appear as TFA on a different date, or not at present, please ask . You can view the TFA blurb at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/July 11, 2014. If it needs tweaking, or if it needs rewording to match improvements to the article between now and its main page appearance, please edit it, following the instructions at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/instructions. The blurb as it stands now is below: Babe Ruth (1895–1948) was an American baseball outfielder and pitcher who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1914 to 1935. Born in Baltimore, Ruth was sent at age seven to St. Mary's, a reformatory where he learned baseball skills. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles. He began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including 714 career home runs. In his fifteen years with the Yankees, Ruth helped them win seven American League pennants and four World Series championships. His big swing led to escalating home run totals that boosted baseball's popularity and made home runs a major factor in the sport. Ruth's unprecedented power and carousing lifestyle made him a larger-than-life figure in the ``Roaring Twenties``. One of the first five inductees into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture, and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. You (and your talk-page stalkers) may also be interested to hear that there have been some changes at the TFA requests page recently. Nominators no longer need to calculate how many ``points`` an article has, the instructions have been simplified, and there's a new nomination system using templates based on those used for DYK suggestions.

He said young boys were treated worse than adults, brought back to the cell raped and with their fingernails pulled out. ``One boy came into the cell bleeding from behind. He couldn't walk.

20578,64017752,"` Let me refresh your memory. pjacobi: Delete - one person's theory, not in any way in contact with academic reserach. Pjacobi My response: Who cares how many people wrote it, or whether it is ``in contact with academic reserach``? If you want to read about things that are ``in contact with academic reserach``, you should subscribe to academic journals. Wikipedia is not an appendage of academia, and the CTMU nowhere relies on ``contact with academic reserach`` to make its points. Please, let's keep our eyes on the ball here. Asmodeus Now please read carefully. 1. Most theories are written by one person; others are free to utilize them (or not) in their own work later on down the line, as they choose. That others have not yet chosen to do so need not reflect on the theory or its applicability to important issues, particularly given the polarization associated with the central focus of the scholastic journal in which the CTMU was published. This is not necessarily a reflection on the theory; it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working, which - inasmuch as we are, after all, talking about philosophy - may ultimately lead nowhere. Indeed, it may merely mean that other scholars are unfamiliar with the theory because they only pay attention to a narrow or professionally closed set of sources.

22658,20502764,"` Basically, the multi-propose Approval Voting we recently used, is designed precisely for that. Approve an alternative means approval, no vote to an alternative means oppose. The result gives that or those alternatives which have highest net voter number, just as Irpen wishes with ``approve & oppose``. The only basic structural weakness of Approval Voting (if voters are honest) actually is that it is not designed to register priority order of a voter and thus not whether an individual approve vote is strong or weak. But even this can be made by enlightened voters, they just need to write ``weak approve`` or ``strong approve`` when voting for any alternative - and the interpretation will be the task of the interpreter. However, what happened with the (yet ongoing) vote is not due to weaknesses of the voting system, but due to the problem that our subject is difficult to name in a generally accepted way. She simply is difficult. There are reasonable, sufficiently-well-founded arguments her to be placed under headings which almost all make some to oppose. And thus the vote splits. This being the basic situation, NO VOTING SYSTEM will ever cure it - unless using ``violence``. Of course a voting system could be designed which favors something and violates some others, and thus a decision will be made - against half of the population who are then totally pissed at. Such voting systems were used by dictators, by oligarchs, etc. Personally, I am somewhat puzzled why not a higher number of people came and put their (perhaps secondary, or label ``weak``) approval to ``Alexandra of Hesse`` - but that is the result of the will of those voters. `",dev,False

The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see.

The CUS Swiss University Conference is the federal body responsible for accrediting university in SwitzerlandEquni (talk) Value of university degrees awarded by private universities in Switzerland In Switzerland, the university education is mostly public and the individual cantons, unless the federal institutes and other federal universities (SUP) UAS directly regulated and controlled by the federal government, however, there is also a significant presenzadi private universities. Switzerland is not required prior authorization and / or state recognition to provide training in settoreuniversitario, organize examinations or issue qualifications. There is the legal value of the securities. Federal or cantonal authorities, within their respective powers, ensure in cases provided by law on the activities of private universities. In Switzerland, except cases specially regulated by law, the judge of the quality and value ofa training is the user or the labor market before the state. In accordance with the tendenzeinternazionali, were introduced in Switzerland accreditation procedures optional (quality certification and / or quality marks) does not discriminate between public offering and private. Accreditation is voluntary and certifies only a external quality assurance and does not imply any recognition of the validity of Questa of that training by the state. The university sector in Switzerland is complex and consequent to the Eurosystem's federal country (A tertiary according classificazioneinternazionale): the federal government regulates and controls the Federal Institutes of Technology and the Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) pubblicheo private. The cantons, according to the Federal Constitution of Switzerland, have sovereignty over the cantonal public universities and private ones operating in its territorio.In each canton then there are laws that govern the cantonal universities so different matter. The Confederation and the cantons have common skills regarding the coordination and development of quality, through the Swiss University Conference (CUS), joint body of university policy academic public. Nationally a Swiss national accreditation agency (OAQ), optionally accredits public universities and private chloro individual curricula, that gives them a quality mark, which however does not in itself confer any recognition and / or the validity of state titles conferred. An institution may apply for accreditation as a university or can 'take credit for certain courses of study only as required by federal law opening Evening University (LAU, RS 414.20). Regarding the value of the securities issued in Switzerland university academics: for the purposes of the exercise of a regulated profession (eg medicine, advocacy, etc.), are cantonal or federal laws regulating the profession that determine which titolisono recognized. For unregulated professions (eg, management, journalism, etc.) Is up to the fact aldatore work ``recognize`` whether or not the value of a degree; significant may be the accreditation or at least a quality certification issued by private entities generally recognized. For the purpose of further studies, is the university where you will continue its work that recognizes the value of a previous title. As is the case for equivalence of qualifications, universities are based on national standards. Private universities recognized to belong to the teaching system based in Switzerland, although not accredited (ie that did not require quality certification optional), however, have the constitutional right to grant university degrees who, without any difference from those issued by public universities, are valid for: the right of access for the purpose of continuation of studies in the university system (public) in Switzerland and abroad, in accordance with national laws and the Lisbon Convention of 1997, the Council of Europe on the mutual recognition of qualifications; for the exercise of regulated professions in Switzerland under the directive of the European Union CE / 2005/36 into force in Switzerland on 1 November 2011; for the purpose of Switzerland's non-regulated professions, that is the free assessment of the companyEquni (talk) `",dev,False

Make no mistake, consensus is definitely against including the irrelevant material in question, but this has become so tendentious a topic, absorbing so much time to deal with near-continuously, that very little of substance has gone into the article for quite some time. I think the only way to get it firmly, thoroughly finished is to gain such overwhelming consensus that it becomes impossible to continue arguing for a while. If this requires a long process of dispute resolution and eventual administrative intervention, so be it. Once it is done, it could be placed in the FAQ with admin blessings, and from then on, dealt with summarily. At this point, I'd rather go the slow, laborious route than the one that allows any wikigaming or false claims. Comments I'm putting this in a separate section because I want to leave the one above to accrue people's thoughts and opinions. Now then... On #2: If Obama loses the election, the campaign efforts of his opponents will demonstrably have had a significant effect on his life, and therefore would merit more prominent placement in the articles about that life; a prime example is John McCain's biography, which notes the smears (illegitimate black child, etc.) that contributed to his loss in 2000. But until then, the stuff about Ayers is simply campaign innuendo and mudslinging, much more appropriate for the campaign article. So my question to those of you who disagree with #2 is this: What exactly is the pertinence of discredited campaign claims to Obama's life story at this time? In all seriousness, I don't get it. There are entire branches of his family that aren't mentioned in the article, and yet are presumably more important to his life story than these claims. On #3: This one is a simple matter to prove or disprove. If a reliable news organization, outside of the context of campaign claims, has discovered evidence that links Obama and Ayers more deeply for example, evidence that Obama was Ayers' protegee, or that Obama secretly admires Ayers' past that would make all the difference. Those of you who disagree with #3, on which news articles are you relying for that disagreement? Certainly, news articles that lend credence to the Obama-Ayers connection, as suggested, may theoretically appear in the future. But we can only reach consensus on what's currently available. If such a news article appears, #3 would of course need to be dropped. If such a news article exists now, I'd like to see it, but if it's an opinion blog, editorial, or story from a biased source, please understand that it doesn't pass muster here. On #5: Please see my responses on #2 and #3. If I've changed your mind, then I suppose you agree now on #5. If not, I'd like to see your thoughts on my responses above. Specific to Noroton: I wasn't responding to your argument. I was making a proposal for consensus. `",dev,False

Hence the term psychedelic. LSD also tends to have stimulant properties (for example, most people cannot sleep or some even relax while under its effects). Deleted paragraph I just removed the following from the physical effects section. Can anyone make heads or tails of it? :Obscure [2006]. Seventeen seated United States senators are implanted with an invasive 'radiation based' neuroprosthetic technology - electrode[s] on the hypothalamus and microscopic wire in the dura or on the inner surface of the skull, which is capable of monitoring and stimulating neural impulse from remote locations [a hardware interface reassembling the feedback in a useable data product on a 'realtime' basis]. LSD is used to mitigate the long term negative effect of the radiation on the brain, though as age and exposure profiles are not uniform some disparity in consumption is anticipated. - 23:02, May 24, 2006 Then this: - :Oh, my. pharmacological section I think the subsection ``effects - pharmacological`` should be renamed to ``effects - pharmacodynamical``, because it handles only the molecular interactions, and not the pharmacokinetics. Secondly, as these molecular actions are the mechanisms that cause all the effects (``physical``, ``psychological``, ``sensory``...), I think that this subsection should be the first in the Effects section, BEFORE describing the consequences of the molecular interactions (following a logic order). I will change this unless anyone has arguments against this proposition. :This sounds like a good idea. A citation is needed for one or more of the following claims: ``There is also some indication that LSD may trigger a dissociative fugue state in individuals who are taking certain classes of antidepressants such as lithium salts and tricyclics. In such a state, the user has an impulse to wander, and may not be aware of his or her actions, which can lead to physical injury.

The fact that Multics didn't support multiple processes per user session, or multiple preemptively-scheduled threads of control per process, has nothing to do with whether it can make full use of multiple processors; it was a multi-user system, and multiple processes could be making ring 0 calls at the same time.

You ``convention`` you mention that contradicts this is nothing more than ignorance you wish to dress up as something more.

Your contribution which is a direct quote from your SSRN publication is also not encyclopedic - as they say over here on Wikipedia. I also disagree with what you are stating. We can discuss this matter here on this discussion page as it is normally done on Wikipedia. I appreciate that you are new on Wikipedia and that you are a well known and top of the class academic. Herewith then the contribution from Prof Baskerville that I removed from the article: *``This the IASB Framework describes (as above) how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways: Firstly, “A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power, capital is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity”. So most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance. *Secondly, you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance e.g. is the capacity of the waterworks, waste water system etc in the local town the same as, or better, than it was last year? Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be chosen to report this. The Framework states: “Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day”. These are two ‘concepts of capital’. *Thirdly, and this is confusing, a legal meaning in the UK arose as follows: English law developed the ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends. The ‘doctrine of capital maintenance’ underpins the legal rules addressing *- payment of dividends to shareholders; *- reduction of a company’s share capital or reserves; *- a company’s purchase of its own shares *and other aspects. From October 2008 private companies in the UK will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court``. So when a commercial lawyer is discussing capital maintenance they may be referring to this third concept.Baskerville, Rachel F., 100 Questions (and Answers) About IFRS (January 24, 2010).

Originally stylus tips were spherical, which resulted in a very small contact area (theoretically a single point but in practice a small area due to deformation of the vinyl under the stylus pressure). Elliptical stylii were then introduced which increased the contact area, reducing wear and increasing fidelity; and the Shibata stylus (also known as hyper-elliptical or line contact) was an extension of this development. The article is correct to point out that the Shibata stylus could give improved playback from a disc already worn by a spherical stylus, since it would maintain contact with un-worn parts of the groove wall. auntiephos`",dev,False

In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then. I returned with to ````. I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for ``trolling and harassment``. I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all. I returned with , truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, ``Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?`` This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now. =Declarations= *I pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.

The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made: :#Bode Miller :#Julia Mancuso :#Shaun White :#Ted Ligety :#Purna :#Akola city :#2010 Winter Olympics :#And many more. . . *I issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia. =Final Thoughts= *The year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier. *To Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you ``would personally !vote oppose to an unblock``. Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked? *I will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum. *I hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it. *I hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles starkly in need of magic.

No one bore it between 1625 and 1638, but it was not ``vacated`` by the Commonwealth like the monarchy was; and anyway, Charles I did not become Prince of Wales in immediate succession to Henry Frederick, so logically that ought to be a ``Vacancy`` as well. `",dev,False

How stupid of me not to have thought of you as the author of that brilliant piece of logic that so fiercely reminds of Alice in Blunderland. Is Barnesen a ``Protestant.`` He says no, he submitted formally to the Pope, but you, with your Infallible Super-Magisterium know something that only God could possibly know - that Biarnesen is (according to your ineffable Omniscience) a crypto-heretic! And then, the further wonder-logic, that because a man's a Protestant, he's incapable of receiving and conveying valid orders. Obviously you have been given a Super-Mandate over and above that given to Peter and his successors by which you have nullified all of Catholic theology and teaching that do not conform to your own looneybin Procrustean constraints. But you must excuse me, I will never ``turn back to your 'god' Moloch. I will stick around with the God of Israel against the High Priestess of Core and Dathan.... - LJM `",dev,False

Dong Cheng has never been one of its member, however, White Wave Bandits said that Dong Cheng was a White Wave Bandit from 2009 edition. Now the Bandits has a new member Zhu Zhi. Yufuluo is now deleted by the simple reason that Benjitheijneb could not find the relavent information.. I recommend you not to edit Dong Cheng page. Instead you'd better to edit White wave bandits. Look the edit history of Dong Cheng page. Benjitheijneb just visited Dong Cheng page just to hamper and hinder the editions of mine. Let's see a movie scene how a Jews edits Dong Cheng page. Again I am waiting now the day when Benjitheijneb created his Zhu Zhi. If someone shitted his dung on the streets, he should be reported to the police and be charged with petit crime. Why you EkmanLi secretly and gentlely wipe out his dungs of the street? If you are eager to do, I'd like you recommened to do it a month later. Anyway.. you have the right to edit it though.

1906,382016279,"Plot summary issue: sniper scope tampering The plot summary states the following: :Unbeknownst to the Doctor the assassin is actually among the delegates. He pulls out a pistol when the Doctor reaches the camera level and shoots the President dead. The crowd sees the Doctor on the catwalk firing the sniper rifle (in an attempt to stop the assassin) and assume he is the killer. I don't think this is correct. The cut when the Doctor fires strongly implies that it is HE who shot the president (a fake-out that's the focus of the cliffhanger, in fact), and not the man in the crowd. Also, it's later revealed that the scope on the Doctor's sniper rifle was tampered with. I'll have to go and check, but it's always been my impression that the scope was tampered with in just such a way that when the Doctor attempted to fire on a would-be assassin in the crowd who was standing in just the right spot, his staser bolt would hit the president instead, in a perfect frame-job.",dev,False

22221,32461120,"` Extensive Welfare System? Presently, Singapore can be politically analysed as a democratic socialist country and has an extensive welfare system, although de facto it has a dominant-party system. We have an extensive welfare system? I know we have no unemployment monetary benefits, no disability monetary benefits, no eldery monetary benefits. (monetary benefits = receiving money from the govt like unemployment claims in developed countries like Australia and the USA) Wasn't there cases back then where poor families who couldn't scrap up enough money to pay for water and electricity bills were featured on the news, and our govt made a statement like ``PUB (public utility board) not running a charity``? *PUB = govt linked monopoly on all public utilities in singapore. They are the only water and electricity provider in the country. Don't worry, I'm not looking for a flame war nor am I a ``govt lackey`` lol. I just want to make this wiki entry as accurate as possible. I think it is pretty good that we do not face wars, terror attacks, famine or natural disasters in Singapore. Though crime rate is considerably high (my low is at zero P), its much harder to get killed or raped here than say in the States. Anyone with knowledge and verifiable sources regarding our ``extensive welfare system`` please enlightened.`",dev,False
