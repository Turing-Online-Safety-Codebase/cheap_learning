The third marker is from the Philippine Historical Society stating, ``This is where Magellen invaded the Philippines``. I am an American but I was raised most of my life in the Philippines. I speak several dialects fluently. My education is completely Filipino. I lived in Basilan, Zamboanga, Davao, Tacloban, Ormoc, Cebu, Naga, Legaspi, Manila, Tagatay, Cavite, Paranaque,Angeles and Baguio. I worked for many companies.

Is that correct or not? ]] ::1) See Talk:Modern_Library#Further_comments ::2) Yes, but it is still basically a rehash. ``Category: suicides`` On checking, I see that the definition of the category is ``Suicides are people who committed suicide.`` In the case of Jack London, the evidence has never been clear. Clarice Stasz calls it a ``biographical myth.`` It was cemented firmly into the cultural consciousness by one particular biography, Irving Stone's Sailor on Horseback, which is widely acknowledged to be a good read but a sloppy mixture of fact, surmise, and rumor. There's little doubt that, as Dale Walker wrote ``He died of kidney failure complicated by a toxic dose or doses of morphine, most likely taken in the throes of pain resulting from kidney stones. The question has always been whether he premeditated his death—knowingly killed himself.`` Walker reaches no conclusion. Russ Kingman called it ``a controversy that probably will never be settled.`` London's death certificate, signed by four doctors, states that his death was due to kidney failure. One of them had ascribed it to accidental morphine overdose but changed his mind. Because of the stigma of suicide, understandably those who opposed London's political views have been quick to accept the notion of suicide. Conversely, those sympathetic to him have tended to question the idea. Jack London certainly belongs in the category of ``alleged suicides`` or even ``probable suicides`` but there is no way he can be put in the category of ``suicides,`` assuming that means people whose death is generally acknowledged to have been suicide. London's racialism and his reporting of Jackson-Jeffries Note added later: Oops, my edit remark was misleading. Nobody has suggested that I'm trying to whitewash Jack London. I'm just stressing that that's not what I'm trying to do. I snipped :Some of the writings of Jack London are disturbing. While he was a reporter, he coined the phrase ``the Great White Hope``, which was used to describe various white opponents of Jack Johnson (the first black world heavyweight boxing champion) in the 1910s for these reasons: *I'm about 90% sure that Jack London did not coin the expression ``the Great White Hope.`` If he did, it would actually be a notable contribution to the language and I'm sure a biographer would have mentioned it. I've read a number of his press accounts; I'll check later but I do not think he even uses that phrase.

Those admins claimed it didn't matter, that I was warring, and that wikipedia is not supposed to be fair and punishments are not punitive but preventative. Now I understand all this, I do, but I still believe in fairness and I guess it's nice to see an admin who checks out both sides and make a just decision, even if that means blocking both users who were warring. So, thanks, I guess. Why blocking? I wish to inform you that I am not the lease bit happy about your previous action. Granted, I am at fault here, but it wasn't orthodox for you to block me without a warning message first. This comes from the fact that I was never aware of WP:Edit war, or that there was an article for WP:Dispute resolution. It would have been easier for me if you mentioned these articles instead of blocking me and telling me why. That, I believe, is called ``stabbing one in the back.`` But don't get me wrong, I did have some time to cool down, and I thank you for that.

Semi-protection The semi-protection of Juventus F.C. is caused by a continuous submission of erroneous information by a number of IP users who kept on adding a player who is not contracted yet to Juventus (he will be part of Juventus only from the 1st of July), and thus not eligible to be included in the ``Current squad`` (namely, Olof Mellberg). This information is obviously erroneous, as the transfer will not be accepted before the new football season officially begins (that's why a disclaimer was included in order to discourage wise users from adding him in the squad, but it proved not to be enough) and the player is obviously not even listed to Juventus FC's website. This is definitely not a ``content dispute``, as you can see. If you do not agree with it, please consider the July 1 deadline is a widely accepted practice by users involved in the WP:WPF project.

Anyway, if you feel my decision is bolder than WP:BOLD, feel free to unprotect it, you have the rights to do so. ::If you want to see my concerns, just have a look at A.C. Milan's history immediately after your unprotection. IP users re-adding Flamini to the team squad (despite the guy is still signed to Arsenal until the 30th of June) and even putting completely false information, such as the transfer of Alberto Gilardino's to ACF Fiorentina (even citing an alleged price); unfortunately, there's no official confirmation of this from both clubs and the main Italian media, so it's merely a rumour. Considering my previous experience in Italian and European football articles, I can ensure you this will keep on going for the whole summer (at least for major teams such as Juventus, AC Milan, Inter Milan and a few others). When such these things become excessive, I think these contributions can be easily considered as disruptive (especially when an editor ignores a disclaimer warning not to include unconfirmed and premature information). In these cases, semi-protection is obviously an option. It's not that different than, for instance, editing George W. Bush, defining him a ``former`` president before his successor is officially named by the U.S. Congress.

I'll add more references from the THOUSANDS of them out there later. 3) You demonstrate your ignorance of the Bible and Jewish traditions: Citing that John said Jesus ``went up to the feast of the Dedication which is held in the winter,`` i.e. HANUKKAH, is NOT ``original research.`` ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THE BIBLE (which you don't) KNOWS that ``the feast of the dedication that is held in the winter IS HANUKKAH.

Until then, and basing my guess on the name alone, and ascribing no gender traits to any of Dayewalker's words or actions, I have referred to Dayewalker as a she. If that is not the correct gender, just cut the rhetoric and say that Dayewalker should be referred to with a male pronoun.

The first result for ``Dayewalker`` is to someone named ``Chris`` on Twitter. No help there, ``Chris`` could be male, could be female.

We know about when the generator went off line and we know when they landed. The rest is deduction. What I cannot tell you is if they were down on an island on their belly, (see Lambrechts opinion of landing chances on Gardener) how long they could operate their radios. Or if their electrical system would have been intact enough to function. I grew up in the age of the vacuum tube and know that it would take a minute or two - to 'warm' up the dynamotor and transmitter to the point where it would achieve full power. This is all assuming they had no serious damage to the airplane. My 'best guess`` (OPINION, don't ask me to put it in the article) is that they probably had at least one hour of operation. The other question is how much ``gain`` they would have gotten from a ``less than optimum`` (to quote the TIGHAR radio guy) length under 1/8 wave, V-type antenna sitting less than six feet off the ground. The answer is probably - but not definitely - not much. We are looking at an actual output from the antenna of perhaps 10-20 watts with a horizontal polarity and bad angle. Perhaps they were heard. Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range. I find it far easier to think that reports of a 'weak carrier`` or 'feeble and unintelligible`` communications being hear are far more likely than someone who claimed to hear her 4/5. :::::::The bottom line - in my humble (and we all know how humble I am) - opinion is that given the best of circumstances, they would have had at least one hour of radio time left if they were out of fuel. `",dev,False

In April of 2003, NOCIRC signed a contract with La Leche League International as an exhibitor and paid for exhibit space for their international conference held in July 2003. Shortly before the event, the board of directors vetoed our admission as exhibitors. Word of our attendance had spread to a minority of Jewish women in the organization who objected to our very presence. NOCIRC has exhibited successfully at literally hundreds of conferences locally, regionally, and nationally. We are asked back year after year. Without religious prejudice, we provide information about the traumatic effects of circumcision. We hand out our information pamphlets in a non-confrontational manner to those who approach our table because they are interested in learning about the issue. Each year, we have a well-received exhibit booth for physicians attending the American Academy of Pediatrics national conference. NOCIRC already counts among its supporters hundreds of LLL members and former members. The silent majority of leaders within League are already on our side. Attendees who were interested would have appreciated our information; those who were not interested would have just walked on by. The vast majority of boys who are circumcised in the United States are not sons of Jewish or Muslim parents. Preventing these non-religious circumcisions has always been the primary focus for NOCIRC. This painful surgery, the most common procedure that baby boys are forced to experience, puts breastfeeding success at risk. Good chest-to-chest positioning requires mom to press her son’s wounded penis up against her body, and the pain makes him unable or unwilling to nurse. La Leche League reported problems with breastfeeding by circumcised infants in their 1981 edition of The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. In 1996, LLL ratified the Mother-Friendly Childbirth Initiative, along with 25 other organizations. The organization accepted ten basic principles for mother-friendly care, including the requirement that service providers must “discourage non-religious circumcision of the newborn.” (on-line at ). The breastfeeding relationship does not begin in a vacuum. In 2002, NOCIRC issued its position statement, “The Effects of Circumcision on Breastfeeding,” available at . Researchers have found that some male babies are unable to suckle the mother’s breast after circumcision. The circumcised infant is in pain and is in an exhausted, weakened, and debilitated condition. The circumcision procedure frequently causes the newborn to withdraw from his environment, interfering with his process of bonding and breastfeeding. La Leche League claims it is a non-sectarian organization. However, when it comes to circumcision, it is a religious organization. A few powerful members are keeping clinical data regarding breastfeeding obstacles out of the hands of all members in order to further their personal religious viewpoint. For six years now they have systematically excluded NOCIRC from simply having a table at their area and national conferences. The Board of Directors has placed a higher priority on protecting religious circumcision than on breastfeeding success for the 94% of non-Jewish, non-Muslim moms. Jewish boys have seven days to establish breastfeeding before undergoing surgery; non-Jewish boys do not because they are circumcised at birth, and thus they are at a greater risk. The Board’s action is hypocritical in light of LLL’s own struggle with those who block the promotion of breastfeeding benefits for fear of upsetting parents. LLL has itself been accused of producing guilt when they describe the advantages of breastfeeding in much the same way that NOCIRC is now being accused by LLL. LLL has an obligation to its members to make available information on how circumcision affects breastfeeding. New and expectant moms need this information ASAP in order to nurture a successful breastfeeding relationship with their sons. NOCIRC can help to insure that this happens. T",dev,False

I did not and still do not have any proof that the mobile version of the website is ``outdated`` as he stated. When I made the edits (prior to my knowledge of mobile being different from the official website) I chose to not change or add a reference because When I clicked on the already present website reference, it automatically took me to the mobile version, being that I was using my mobile device to make the edits. Due to prior research of the fighters involved in the first three bouts and common knowledge of the sport, all common sense and logic led to me believing (like I always did) that the order of the bouts on the mobile version was the correct one. As soon as I found out the mobile version and official version were different I re-edited the page to rearrange the bouts to the most logical order and changed the prior reference from the official site to the mobile.

These basic counting principles are responsible for all of mathematics, including analysis. There is only one mathematics. There is no distinction between discrete and continuous mathematics that is not exposed as an illusion if you look hard enough. There are no walls. It's fine to think about discrete mathematics in the same sort of loose way that people think about the distinction between number theory and combinatorics. For example, the Goldbach conjecture is easily stated combinatorially, and that's fine as long as you recognise the inherent looseness in what these two areas of mathematics represent. An article about ``discrete mathematics`` can never be very good. All it can say, is that discrete mathematics is a hodgepodge of areas of mathematics which do not implictly involve the areas of real or complex analysis, or topology, for their study.

21851,345331960,"` Personal Observations As a native low german speaker (westphalia) under the age of fifty, living in England, I would like to add some comments to this discussion. I still speak my mother tongue anytime I call my family or if I visit hy hometown on the dutch border. Within my family I speak low german with my parents, almost all my older relatives, and three of my younger siblings. But I speak high german with my two youngest siblings and most of the younger members of the local community. I only know of a handful of my peergroup that have opted for speaking low german with their children. So whilst I think the number of native low german speakers is still in the higher six digit numbers if not millions, it is sadly dwindling fast. A few years ago I met the parents of a danish friend in London and whilst they spoke no english or german and I spoke no danish, we quickly established that we each spoke a version of low german and were thus able to communicate. Also, whilst in South Africa, I was able to understand some of the Africaans based on my low german. Infact, when our host uttered an exclamation, his pronounciation was absolutely identical to that of my mother. One contributor spoke of local variations not existing anymore. I disagree. My mother and fathers families are from a town only a few miles down the road from my hometown. I vividly remember being asked 'where do you come from' when I started work. As if I was from another planet. Only because in my familie we say 'kerke' not 'karke' (spelling of my low german is total guess work... I never used it in any written form though people often make up low german poems for wedding invites etc..) These variations are still in place and people do recognise if someone is from a town further afield. I used to vary my own low german accent depending on whom I spoke to. As you will have noticed, I have called it low german throughout. That is because it is the only phrase that has made any sense to my english audience when I have tried to explain that high german is not my mother tongue. I believe that this whole discussion is based on a (to some extent understandable) aversion of many dutch people to be thrown into one pot with anything german. Personally, I think that this is rather sad. As someone else said... we are very much one people. I feel that I have far more in common with the low german speakers on either side of the border than with the high german speakers of my regional capital for example. The people that home in on any devision are mostly the same that cause problems in any society. Mainly of a certain age and gender. Why? Why not celebrate the heritage we have in common? Any dutch person speaking low german should feel no more german than a german person should feel indien due to speaking an indo-european language. If someone you know names their child with a name that has bad connotations for you... it really does not take that long before the name in your mind is connected to the child, not the person you knew previously under that name. I am curious... are any of the other participants in this talk actually native low german/dutch speakers themselves? It did not seem to me from what people have posted. As such it confirms what I think holds true for many things. Those that are converted to something are far more zealous than those that grew up with it. Food for thought there..... :I am a Dutchman, and Dutch speaker, and in the Low Countries, your dialect is called ``Low Saxon``. Dutch linguistics uses ``Low German`` only as a linguistic marker and the precise meaning of ``german`` in ``low German`` is explained as wel, and has not got the same meaning as ``german`` in general. You remark that you think you have more in common with the Dutch than speakers of High German is somewhat unrealistic to me. You might see a lot of similarities with the Dutch living near your border, but the idea that the Dutch as a whole are culturally closer is somewhat strange. I think that if you look closer you'll see that you have a lot more in common with someone from Austria than one from the Netherlands. Not just culturally, but in some cases linguistically as well. ::She's speaking of Low Saxons in the Netherlands, not of all Dutch, I guess. And I'm sure, it is true, that the Dutch Low Saxon dialects are nearer to her Westfalian Low Saxon than the dialect of Düsseldorf. ::A North German may be linguistically closer to an Austrian than to someone from the Netherlands, but that is only because most North Germans do not speak Low German any more.

2193,38256961,"` Coomplaint procedure? No doubt there is a lot of link spam. But no doubt many contributors of good articles start small and then build the piece in layers. That's completely human and completely understandable. The better recourse would have been to insert that tag about possible deletion, rather than deleting within such a short period of time. I had just created the stub. I am new to Wiki and perceived that I was up against a vandal. Indeed I was. How much more disturbing to learn that the destroyer has some form of administrative rights. I'm new here, and it's not a paying job, clearly. I'm not sure I want to learn the ropes of Wikipedia politics and egos, as the obvious value of Wikipedia is compelling enough, and the ugliness of personalities warped by power within a volunteer effort is unhealthy to that effort. The impulse to characterize someone who stands up for their contribution as ``nasty`` or ``threatening`` ... the see-what-I-mean response to a contributor not aware of the emotional satisfaction some may draw from arbitrary deletions, from deliberately provoked confrontations to assure themselves of their own power, is sad. All my foregoing comments no doubt cements some of you more firmly in your smugness and self-satisfaction. Regardless of the barnacles that cling to its hull, I assert that the Wiki concept is, fortunately, apparently more powerful than the base human dynamics it nurtures but does not ultimately tolerate. i am asked to let it drop. I don't claim to be a Wiki expert, but I bet there is a complaint procedure. Anyone care to point me in the right direction? The article stub was summarily deleted three times, but after that, the vandal chose to insert an alert of possible deletion instead. This indicates to me that the proper procedure was not followed the first three times. What's the complaint procedure? My further complaint will be regarding the dynamic of portraying someone who stands up for themselves in a reasoned and civil way as having an attitude problem.

Originally stylus tips were spherical, which resulted in a very small contact area (theoretically a single point but in practice a small area due to deformation of the vinyl under the stylus pressure). Elliptical stylii were then introduced which increased the contact area, reducing wear and increasing fidelity; and the Shibata stylus (also known as hyper-elliptical or line contact) was an extension of this development. The article is correct to point out that the Shibata stylus could give improved playback from a disc already worn by a spherical stylus, since it would maintain contact with un-worn parts of the groove wall. auntiephos`",dev,False

14592,625627534,"`The official WWE Facebook fan page for WWE Superstar Roman Reigns. Biography WWE is in Roman Reigns’ blood. The son of WWE Hall of Famer Sika of The Wild Samoans, Reigns is a member of the storied Anoa’i wrestling family — a lineage that includes intimidating powerhouses like Yokozuna, Umaga and Rikishi. But this 265-pounder possesses an explosive combination of strength and speed his relatives never imagined possible. A star defensive tackle at Georgia Tech, Reigns wrecked offensive guards for both the Minnesota Vikings and the Jacksonville Jaguars before answering his family calling to become a WWE Superstar. The hulking Samoan brought his smash-mouth gridiron style to WWE’s developmental system, NXT, where he left a long line of tough opponents in crumpled heaps. But it was at the 2012 Survivor Series that Reigns made his greatest impact. In the heat of a Triple Threat Match between WWE Champion CM Punk, John Cena and Ryback, Reigns hit the ring alongside fellow WWE NXT competitors Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins and unleashed a merciless attack on the mighty Ryback. Tearing at the beast like a pack of hungry jackals, the young competitors ruined Ryback’s opportunity to win the WWE Title and drove him through a ringside table. The following night, the trio put the wrecking ball through a table again after Ryback attempted to break up Punk’s celebration for his one year as WWE Champion. Rumors that the group was working in collusion with The Straight Edge Superstar quickly spread, but those ties were strongly denied when Reigns, Rollins and Ambrose sat down with Michael Cole for an interview. Branding themselves “The Shield,” the band of upstarts in black tactical gear claimed that they weren’t in WWE to aid Punk, but to halt injustice. The Shield took on Ryback and Team Hell No in the first-ever Six-Man Tables, Ladders & Chairs Match. The harrowing contest may have intimidated other upstarts, but Reigns and company proved they were up to the task when they took out their hardened opponents in a brutal fight. In The Shield’s second sanctioned WWE match at Elimination Chamber against an all-star trio of John Cena, Sheamus & Ryback, The Shield’s hunt for justice continued with a shocking victory, which they replicated the next night on Raw against Sheamus, Ryback & Chris Jericho. Although Reigns suffered a KO Punch at the hands of Big Show on SmackDown on March 1, several days later on Raw, just after the show went off the air, Reigns, Rollins and Ambrose got devastating revenge as they dropped The World’s Largest Athlete with a titanic triple powerbomb. They struck again the next week, dropping Big Show again during his singles match against Rollins and later assaulting an unsuspecting Randy Orton & Sheamus following their bout against Team Rhodes Scholars. The men in black challenged Orton and Sheamus to a Six-Man Tag Team Match at WrestleMania 29 with a partner of their choice. However, their selected Superstar, Ryback, was later removed from the bout and Orton and Sheamus were left one man down heading into WrestleMania until Big Show joined the team on the March 25 edition of Raw. Reigns and his teammates looked impressive on The Grandest Stage of Them All. Reigns' power contributed to The Shield's team effort, which overcame Orton, Sheamus and Big Show's shaky relationship, leading to the black-clad trio's first WrestleMania victory. The next night was a less glorious affair, however, after Team Hell No interrupted The Shield's attempted attack on The Undertaker, uniting with The Deadman to send the ``Hounds of Justice`` into retreat. Two weeks later, The Shield took to the ring yet again and emerged victorious, this time defeating The Undertaker and Team Hell No on Raw. Though The Deadman paid the trio back in kind with a singles in over Dean Ambrose on SmackDown, The Shield rallied once again to Triple Powerbomb The Phenom through the annonuce table all the same. Although The Shield's motives have been questioned, any doubts in their abilities have already been answered.`",dev,False

20083,36545135,"Gen Y begins in 1978 Gen Y definitely begins in 1978. A previous author was right when she mentioned that people born in that era (1978-1984) are pretty in between, the same way people born in the early 1960s are between the classic generation X and the classic baby boom. I think there is a difference between early Generation Yers (1978-1984) and late Generation Yers (1985-1994) but I don't think people born after about 1993 or 1994 can be included in Generation Y. Part of being Gen Y is being a child of a baby boomer. My parents were born in 1955 and I was born in 1990. The baby boomers are a pretty unified generation, and even my parents consider themselves to be part of a different generation than people born in the 1940s. My parents are children of the '70s, Watergate era, and came of age as adults during the late 1970s and early 1980s yuppie/disco era. Meanwhile, someone born in 1946 remembers the conformity of the 1960s and was in high school as opposed to grade school during the JFK assassination, and could have been drafted for Vietnam. They were old enough to take part in the antiwar protests or go to Woodstock. After about 1954 the boomers were children of the '70s, while before they were children of the '60s. The same distinction exists between early and late Y. Early Y is a transitional group between Generation X and Generation Y, and their coming-of-age was characterized by alot of change (PCs, etc.) Also, their parents included more Vietnam vets and protestors, and hippies, while most people my age have parents whose adolescent preoccupations were disco and Led Zeppelin-type rock, Watergate and the oil crisis.

Purdue University offers the flexibility needed for such a vast and rapidly changing field. The research facilities and the faculty at the university are par excellent. Communications is an industry that has changed our lives. In a very short period it has changed the way we have looked at things since centuries. It is one industry that is going to shape our future for centuries to come. Hence my desire to do masters in electrical engineering with communications as my major. My interest in electronics blossomed during my high school years. It was the time when technology had begun to make an impact on the lives of people in India. Hence engineering with electronics as my major was the first choice for my undergraduate studies. Right since the beginning of my undergraduate study electronics is a subject that has fascinated me with its power of applications. The subjects that I have studied include Linear Electronics, Digital Electronics. These laid the foundation for my courses in Electronic Communication & Communication Systems at a later stage. My undergraduate studies already focus on the communications aspect of electronics. A masters degree in electrical engineering with communications as major field is the next logical step. For the past four months I have been working as a project trainee at the Indian Institute for Advanced Electronics. I am working on the design and development of a ``PC Controlled Digital Serial Data Generator``. This short stint has given me invaluable practical experience. It has given me the confidence to pursue a masters degree and also kindled a desire to do research. During the course of my work at IIAE, I have come across several scientists. Most of them work in different areas of communications. Interactions with them have made me realize the vastness and the scope of communications. My discussions with them convinced me that specializing in communications will suit me very well. The subject of research which interests me very much is spread spectrum communication systems. Coding theory and combinations is another research subject which arouses my curiosity. The subject Communication Theory which I am studying at present introduces these topics in theory. I am eager to find out more about the applications of coding theory to spread spectrum communication systems. In addition I have been a student member of the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.) for the past three years. Through its workshops/seminars and publications like the 'The Spectrum' it has exposed me to a lot of emerging technologies in the field of communications. It is a strong belief in my family that the American education system has the best to offer in the whole world.

Pjacobi My response: Who cares how many people wrote it, or whether it is ``in contact with academic reserach``? If you want to read about things that are ``in contact with academic reserach``, you should subscribe to academic journals. Wikipedia is not an appendage of academia, and the CTMU nowhere relies on ``contact with academic reserach`` to make its points. Please, let's keep our eyes on the ball here. Asmodeus Now please read carefully. 1. Most theories are written by one person; others are free to utilize them (or not) in their own work later on down the line, as they choose. That others have not yet chosen to do so need not reflect on the theory or its applicability to important issues, particularly given the polarization associated with the central focus of the scholastic journal in which the CTMU was published. This is not necessarily a reflection on the theory; it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working, which - inasmuch as we are, after all, talking about philosophy - may ultimately lead nowhere. Indeed, it may merely mean that other scholars are unfamiliar with the theory because they only pay attention to a narrow or professionally closed set of sources. You have improperly recommended this article for deletion on those grounds, and that was wrong of you as a Wikipedia editor. This leads us to 2. It makes no difference whether a theory is ``notable to academic researchers`` (whether or not this is the case). It has been patiently explained to you that academics are not the ones who make this particular theory notable; it is notable because it was covered by highly reputable sources in the popular media, and because it has a remarkable structure that no other theory possesses. Again, citing the superficially apparent inattention of academia as grounds for deletion was irresponsible of you as a Wikipedia editor. You have voted to delete an informative, well-verified article about a notable topic on irrelevant or nebulous grounds for which you have no verification. In so doing, you have let Wikipedia and its readership down. Please be more responsible about your editing activities in the future. `",dev,False

Frankly anyone who links to these sorts of websites has zero credibility in my book when it comes to discussions about genetics. The people who run these websites are not interested in genetics, they are interested in racism, and they are interested in distorting science, in lying about what science tells us, so they can pretend it supports their twisted agenda. Is it so difficult to actually link to the original paper, where you can read what the scientists who publish the work say, rather than sites like gnxp where everything if distilled through a racist filter?

We cannot infer migrations or time depth from autosomes. Whereas Y chromosomes and mtDNA give the impression that there are discrete groups of people in the world, this is misleading because they only trace a single lineage. A man's Y chromosome represents only a single ancestor out of thousands, ditto a person's mtDNA. Autosomal analysis shows us just how mixed up we all are. These papers are instructive because they show that humans in Europe do not cluster into discrete groups, but that diversity is isolated by distance. This means that one's cultural group is not a good indicator of one's genetics (ie French or German or English), but the geographical region one comes from is a good indicator of one's genetics. These papers provide evidence that researchers like Seldin et al. and Bauchet et al. were wrong when they conducted clustering analyses on genetic data from Europe. Genetic diversity does not cluster into groups, it is distributed along gradients, as anthropologists have been telling us for decades, there are not ``races``, there is a smooth continuum of change.

5738,103452654,"`|IThink4u]] :The psychoactive drug page should help you with that. LSD is legally classified as a hallucinogen, although that term is too broad for the specific actions of LSD. Hence the term psychedelic. LSD also tends to have stimulant properties (for example, most people cannot sleep or some even relax while under its effects). Deleted paragraph I just removed the following from the physical effects section. Can anyone make heads or tails of it? :Obscure [2006]. Seventeen seated United States senators are implanted with an invasive 'radiation based' neuroprosthetic technology - electrode[s] on the hypothalamus and microscopic wire in the dura or on the inner surface of the skull, which is capable of monitoring and stimulating neural impulse from remote locations [a hardware interface reassembling the feedback in a useable data product on a 'realtime' basis]. LSD is used to mitigate the long term negative effect of the radiation on the brain, though as age and exposure profiles are not uniform some disparity in consumption is anticipated. - 23:02, May 24, 2006 Then this: - :Oh, my. pharmacological section I think the subsection ``effects - pharmacological`` should be renamed to ``effects - pharmacodynamical``, because it handles only the molecular interactions, and not the pharmacokinetics. Secondly, as these molecular actions are the mechanisms that cause all the effects (``physical``, ``psychological``, ``sensory``...), I think that this subsection should be the first in the Effects section, BEFORE describing the consequences of the molecular interactions (following a logic order). I will change this unless anyone has arguments against this proposition. :This sounds like a good idea. A citation is needed for one or more of the following claims: ``There is also some indication that LSD may trigger a dissociative fugue state in individuals who are taking certain classes of antidepressants such as lithium salts and tricyclics. In such a state, the user has an impulse to wander, and may not be aware of his or her actions, which can lead to physical injury. SSRIs are believed to interact more benignly, with a tendency to significantly reduce LSD's subjective effects. MAOIs, on the other hand, may increase LSD's subjective effects, particularly those effects which are experienced as 'negative'.`` :I believe I've taken care of this.

It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology? Many regular writers on Wikipedia are lying liars and the lies they tell include the top media cover-ups. They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance [URL] that reveal its original straight-arm salute. They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the ``Nationalism`` movement, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party.`` They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin [URL] of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth [URL] that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome. They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at [URL] and at [URL] showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute [URL] is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (``Hakenkreuz`` in German). Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.`` Hitler altered his own signature [URL] to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist.`` Wikipedia's liars cover up for the swastika [URL] and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's liars cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party [URL] by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand ``Nazi.`` Many Wikipedia posters are liars in that there was no ``Nazi Party`` because it was actually the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party`` and the party members did not call themselves ``Nazis`` nor the ``Nazi Party.`` The term ``Nazi`` developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a ``Nazi`` too, in that the term means ``National Socialist.`` The term ``Nazi`` is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Wikipedia's liars use the term ``Nazi`` and the misnomer ``Nazi Party`` to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's liars cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together [URL] as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, [URL] of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part. Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies [URL] of the media. [URL] Wikipedia should not be cited for support because it is no different than quoting various anonymous sources who have no knowledge of the topic [URL] or who have lies to spread about the topic. The Wikipedia article for the ``Roman salute`` used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by liars who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: ``The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic.

At least this time it was actually apparently you who did it. Nice change. Are you just going to delete and ignore the people who are trying to get you to see the problems that exist? How about fixing the problems? Your social experiment can't work under the weight of political warfare. Abuse is rampant, the abused have no real recourse. Gaming the system is too simple, and enough people are doing it that it is now part of what is simply required to be here. You don't have a creative or collaborative encyclopedia; You have a psycholigcal war zone. What are you going to do about it? My suggestion, as an Expert in Sociology, Psychology, Systems Theory, Communications Theory, And Political Science is that The problem stems from the sheer quantity of ignorant pov warriors versus the smaller number of available experts, and the techniques and tactics that can be employed against reason, fact, knowledge, ot sense. I see the same problem Larry Sanger Saw, But i know that the solution isn't to become elitist, it is instead to create interactions that are meritocratic instead of based in pack psychology and mob or riot group movements. LOGIC, which is what ANY serious educational or informational service has to eventually use, is the only solution to your problems. Logic ends most of the tools used by pack psychology, ends psychological warfare tactics, exposes ignorance and lies and misinformation, as well as bad reasoning, and levels the playing feild enough so that an Expert has a chance to actually confront that mob. Unless you ban me, or I am blocked, I'll continue to attempt to talk with you about this problem, and it will start to pop up in as many places as i looks like it needs in order to get the attention it deserves. Avoidance isn't going to solve the problems, and, to be truthful, blocking me is only getting rid of the one thing that could have bailed you out; A lucid whos Agenda is to help you write the best encylopedia ever; who nonetheless understands the facts of the entropy you are experiencing and who knows how to deal with it and what the solutions to those problems are. It will be better for you, and for everybody concerned, if you adress the problems, and work with those who are capable of being lucid relevant to those problems to solve those problems. Unless your goal is to have entropy and pack psychology dominate the world, and to be yet one more example of how politics and pack psychology enforce intentional ignorance and doublethink propagandas. Lets start with square one. Knowledgable experts ought to be able to as much as float an outline on a talk page without having it deleted by pov warriors whos agenda is to keep the conversation in drama. People who are seriously abused by others ought to have realistic and swift recourse regarding that abuse. People should not be allowed to stack RFCs with their freinds. People should not be allowed to stack votes for deletion with their freinds. People should not be allowed to attack others and then cite them for personal attacks if they as much as respond with a simple mirrored reflection of the original attack. Pov warriors should not have pet rogue admins blocking people on trumped up charges to silence them for making noise about serious abuses. Wikipedia should not be psychological combat. And Yet, it is. Since it vanished into the ethers, lets recap the more angry and to the point message you failed to answer. - Wikipedia IS evil [23] It is host to the same big political groupthink game that goes on in all of the rest of civilization. It is a battleground for propaganda warfare, a lawless game in which anything can be said as long as its in ``neutral`` language even if its a propagandists lie, and even if it exists only to dispute a known fact. It is a place notable mostly for what it conspicuously lacks. There are in general thousands of articles which tell us about as much as a High Schooler might, and which then devolve into factoids and rhetoric. The expertise of depth knowledge is missing. No expert would submit themselves to a situation of patent pack psychology informational riot. Wikipedia is Evil. And You, Jimbo Wales, are the guy who created it. Maybe you should try some Formal Logic in the mix. Maybe this ``Randian`` Environment could use some controls on its chaos vectors. Maybe even a realistic and functional methodology for dealing with abuse might be in order. Nice graphic box at the top of the page says to go post at the admin desk,. Funny, i tried that, and got less than no result. Abusiveness is rampant and the organization is headless. I can tell Wikipedia in fifty places what its problems are and how to solve them, but wikipedias nose is in the air, and the God king doesn't seem to read his talk page. What you have here isn't an encyclopedia, and in pretending, all that it offers a legitamate participant over the long term is abuse. The admin desk won't help you if you are being attacked and baited with ad hominems; they don't even know what one is. They aren't required to pick up any education to become admins; they come with the standard prole ``opinion`` fully intact, and no knowledge to back anything up. Good luck with your evil science social sciences project. Let me know if you want any help to fix it. Prometheuspan Larry Sanger has the same diagnosis that i do. I have more to offer in terms of how to solve the problem. But not whilst being blocked by trolls and their pet admins for making the effort. ``Wikipedia has, to its credit, done something about the most serious trolling and other kinds of abuse: there is an Arbitration Committee that provides a process whereby the most disruptive users of Wikipedia can be ejected from the project. But there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation, let alone arbitration. A few of the project's participants can be, not to put a nice word on it, pretty nasty. And this is tolerated. So, for any person who can and wants to work politely with well-meaning, rational, reasonably well-informed peoplewhich is to say, to be sure, most people working on Wikipediathe constant fighting can be so off-putting as to drive them away from the project. This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) I need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. Consequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to ``work with`` persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). This lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. This lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively an",dev,False

Below is the entire message I sent Rianna which you conveniently altered. Further, Rianna knows full well she asked for a change to the get site today because the article had not been edited for three days. She asked to change a couple of lines relating to Ms. Bruker and to remove the fact that she had an affair because it was not relevant to ths issue. Bruno then denied her change. This was in the history of edits secions which I somewhere have saved. Nishkid then changed the history section to show Rianna's change without the notice of line was changed. This is fraud and if an attorney did this in Federal Court, he would be disbarred and possibly charged with contempt of court. In response to Nishkid's question in the email to me, I think that he is not telling the truth and is equivocating about what Rianna really sent to her. From what I have read on her page, she would be quite offended at the vindictive behaviour of these men.

3321,244839681,"` please observe these Wiki guidelines on the Pro se page In the Wiki model, an article which may currently be poorly written, poorly formatted, lack sufficient sources, or not be a comprehensive overview of the subject, can be improved and rewritten to fix its current flaws. That such an article is lacking in certain areas is a relatively minor problem, and such articles can still be of benefit to Wikipedia. In other words, the remedy for such an article is cleanup, not deletion.`` ``But the purpose of an encyclopedia is to provide information: the potential readership or subjective usefulness of each item does not have to be justified if the material is notable.`` `` while some editors may dislike certain kinds of information, that alone isn't enough by itself for something to be deleted. This may be coupled with (or replaced by) the unexplained claim that they feel that the information is ``unencyclopedic`` (see #Just unencyclopedic, above). Such claims require an explanation of whichpolicy the content fails and and explanation of why that policy applies as the rationale for deletion. (See also #Pointing at policy.)`` ``Wikipedia editors are a pretty diverse group of individuals, and potentially, any subject or topic may be liked or disliked by some editor somewhere. However, personal preference is not a valid reason to keep or delete an article.`` ``It is insufficient to simply assert that an article (or the subject of an article) is not appropriate for Wikipedia.`` ``The debate is not a vote; please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments`` and the same applies to all deletion debates. Any statement that just consists of ``Keep`` or ``Delete`` with a signature can easily be dismissed by the admin making the final decision, and changing ``Keep`` to ``Strong keep`` will not make it any more relevant. Try to present persuasive reasons in line with policy or consensus as to why the article/template/category/whatever should be kept/deleted, and try to make sure it is an argument based on the right reasons.`` [URL] `",dev,False

I reintroduced ``Macedonian`` for Alexander's empire and for the succeeding generals (Diadochi). :The historians consider the “kingdom” of Alexander the Great or some of succession states (Seleucid) as “empires” (see Bosworth, A. B., Alexander the Great part 2, B,: Greece and the conquered territories, pp 859 and further, in: The Cambridge Ancient History, VI, The fourth century B. C. 1994. This has never been challenged. Modern European historians are even more loose when defining empires, listing over 20 empires in the past; see Maurice Diverger (Ed.) Le Concept d’empire, PUF, 1980 (also chapter IV, Pierre Leveque: Empire d’Alexandre et empires helléniques, who includes Egypt also as an empire), as literally all Ptolemys and Cleopatras were ethnic Macedonians. The Macedonians were quite ethnocentric as it could be judged from our today’s point of view. Almost all high positions in the army were held by Macedonians (see Borza, E.N., Makedonika, pp152-158) and Diadochi were all Macedonians. Also, the ethnic Macedonian army occupied the most important place in the empire(s). I do not understand why you all (Greeks?) insist on removing “Macedonian” from all designation of the Macedonian state, kingdom or empire? I do not know eminent historian who dismisses the “Macedonian” designation when talking of Alexander’s or Diadochy kingdoms. Do you? I explained at other places that political and cultural designations should not be confounded and would involve historiography error. These states are not politically but culturally designed as Hellenistic, and this is important so stress because as we understand today, cultural heritage had important impact on all sections of life including political aspects as well, but they must be seen separately.

I am working my way through the order Caryophyllales, and this was blocked up completely because of the Nepenthes-items. These were categorized in Nepenthaceae a subcategory of both Caryophyllales and of Carnivorous plants and in both these main categories. This is against common sense and against the guidelines on categorization. The result was a hopeless mess. I tried to gently nudge into cleaning up his act, but he did not get it. I did not feel like getting into a big hassle and tried to do the sensible thing. :::Categorization depends on the number and nature of the things to be categorized. This means that on the whole there is no fixed ``right categorization`` but that it needs to be adjusted as items are added. At the moment the Category Caryophyllales contains lots of non-related items, and the exceptions belong to the family Cactaceae (in category Cacti, which looks to be allright) and a few genera only (Amaranthus, Drosera, Nepenthes) so at this moment it seems clearest to move these items into subcategories dedicated to each genus this has several advantages. As items are added it will be wise to look at it again and to add new subcategories. As I see it, at this moment this looks best. However I have not finished yet; a category should not contain that much over 150 items and Caryophyllales will be near the upper limit even after Nepenthes is properly filed away. The same goes for Carnivorous plants, although as I said I have no real interest in those and would gladly leave that to you, as long as it does not interfere with Caryophyllales. `",dev,False

This whole thing dates to the early days of the ramblers, and the recreational interest in the landscape (as opposed to those too busy trying to live in it) On finding ley-lines, it took me a while to hunt it down, but this is a passage I remembered from John Crowley's excellent novel Ægypt: Star temples and ley-lines, UFOs and landscape giants, couldn't they see what was really, permanently astonishing was the human ability to keep finding these things? Let anyone looking for them be given a map of Pennsylvania or New Jersey or the Faraways, and he will find ``ley-lines``; let human beings look up long enough on starry nights and they will see faces staring down at them. That's the interesting thing, that's the subject: not why there are ley-lines, but why people find them...

Advice on uploading images Hello! Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia. I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images. *Pick an image name. :When uploading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique. Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive. *Source the image. :On the image description page, explain where the image came from. If you created the image yourself, then say so. If it's from the web, give a URL. If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title. *Provide copyright and license information. :This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important. The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it. ::If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you own the copyright. To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.) Do this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{PD-self}}. Be sure to mention that you created the image. If you're using {{PD-self}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain. ::If you didn't create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might ``create``, but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image. Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content. This means that images cannot have a restriction such as ``only for use by Wikipedia``, or ``for non-commercial use only``, or ``for educational use``. Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under fair use, but such a use should be justified on the image description page. *Describe the image. :To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood. A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page. Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article. Some links to Wikipedia pages on this subject: Copyrights, Copyright tags, Fair use, Image description page, Public domain, Images for deletion, Possibly unfree images, Copyright problems, Uploading images Thanks again for your contributions. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me at my talk page. Unspecified source for Image:Heather.jpg Thanks for uploading Image:Heather.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, then you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, then their copyright should also be acknowledged. As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media meets the criteria at Wikipedia:Fair use, use a tag such as or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair use. See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use. If you have uploaded other files, consider checking that you have specified their source and tagged them, too. You can find a list of files you have uploaded by following [ this link]. Unsourced and untagged images may be deleted one week after they have been tagged, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If the image is copyrighted under a non-free license (per Wikipedia:Fair use) then the image will be deleted 48 hours after . If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. Image copyright problem with Image:Heather.jpg Thank you for uploading Image:Heather.jpg. However, it currently is missing information on its copyright status. Wikipedia takes copyright very seriously. It may be deleted soon, unless we can determine the license and the source of the image. If you know this information, then you can add a copyright tag to the image description page.

Make no mistake, consensus is definitely against including the irrelevant material in question, but this has become so tendentious a topic, absorbing so much time to deal with near-continuously, that very little of substance has gone into the article for quite some time. I think the only way to get it firmly, thoroughly finished is to gain such overwhelming consensus that it becomes impossible to continue arguing for a while. If this requires a long process of dispute resolution and eventual administrative intervention, so be it. Once it is done, it could be placed in the FAQ with admin blessings, and from then on, dealt with summarily. At this point, I'd rather go the slow, laborious route than the one that allows any wikigaming or false claims. Comments I'm putting this in a separate section because I want to leave the one above to accrue people's thoughts and opinions. Now then... On #2: If Obama loses the election, the campaign efforts of his opponents will demonstrably have had a significant effect on his life, and therefore would merit more prominent placement in the articles about that life; a prime example is John McCain's biography, which notes the smears (illegitimate black child, etc.) that contributed to his loss in 2000. But until then, the stuff about Ayers is simply campaign innuendo and mudslinging, much more appropriate for the campaign article. So my question to those of you who disagree with #2 is this: What exactly is the pertinence of discredited campaign claims to Obama's life story at this time? In all seriousness, I don't get it. There are entire branches of his family that aren't mentioned in the article, and yet are presumably more important to his life story than these claims. On #3: This one is a simple matter to prove or disprove. If a reliable news organization, outside of the context of campaign claims, has discovered evidence that links Obama and Ayers more deeply for example, evidence that Obama was Ayers' protegee, or that Obama secretly admires Ayers' past that would make all the difference. Those of you who disagree with #3, on which news articles are you relying for that disagreement? Certainly, news articles that lend credence to the Obama-Ayers connection, as suggested, may theoretically appear in the future. But we can only reach consensus on what's currently available. If such a news article appears, #3 would of course need to be dropped. If such a news article exists now, I'd like to see it, but if it's an opinion blog, editorial, or story from a biased source, please understand that it doesn't pass muster here. On #5: Please see my responses on #2 and #3. If I've changed your mind, then I suppose you agree now on #5. If not, I'd like to see your thoughts on my responses above.

23108,203493327,"` Mario Party 4 is the fourth in a series of board game style video games for Nintendo platforms, featuring popular Nintendo characters. It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003. Mario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3. The game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten). Battle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. Every Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each. A new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games. Players play in a very elaborate mini-game that ends when one player is eliminated in various ways. (See Bowser mini-game section below) The loser loses a pre-specified item, usually coins or items. Gameplay =Boards= * Toad's Midway Madness * Goomba's Greedy Gala * Koopa's Seaside Soiree * Shy Guy's Jungle Jam * Boo's Haunted Bash * Bowser's Gnarly Party (Clear Story Mode to unlock it) Spaces There is various spaces you can land in the game. The following is a list of them, and what they do. *Blue Space - You get three coins. Also, there is a special feature on this game called Hidden Blocks, in which a star or coins may be hidden on random blue spaces. *Red Space - You lose three coins. *Green Happening Space - A special board event takes place. *Warp Space - You are sent to the same space as an opponent. A spinner chooses which opponent's space you will warp to. *Mushroom Space - Two boxes will appear (one big and one small). Choose one, and you will be given either a Mini Mushroom or a Mega Mushroom. (Note: The Mega Mushroom is not always in the large box, and the Mini Mushroom is not always in the small box.) *Battle Space - A battle minigame will start in which players put a chosen amount of coins into a pot. The better you finish in the minigame, the more coins you will get back from the pot. *Bowser Space - Bowser may steal items from players or a Bowser minigame may begin. *Fortune Space - A reversal of fortune begins, in which players may have to give coins or stars to others. The player who landed on it plays a game like pinball that chooses the two players involved as well as what will be given, taken, or swapped. =Board Events= *Item Shop: You can buy items here that will help you gain an advantage in the game. If you have three items, have no coins, or it's the last turn, you wont be able to buy anything. *Lottery Shop: Pay 5 coins to play a lottery game. There is either the scratcher ticket game, where the player chooses 1 out of 12 tickets win a prize. A 1 will give 100 coins, a 2 will give 30 coins, a 3 will give a Mega Mushroom and a ``Try Again`` gives nothing. Another game is the Ball Game, based purely on chance. Spin the machine and get a ball. A gold ball gives 100 coins, a pink ball gives 30 coins, a blue ball gives a Mega Mushroom, and a white ball gives nothing. **Lucky Party Ticket: The first time you enter in the Lottery shop, you will receive a Lucky Party Ticket. During the last 5 turns, a Lottery Drawing will take place.

[URL] [URL] If you are too lazy and full of yourself to read them in their entirety then I will just post the relevant sections here: Camille Paglia: ``On the other hand I’ve been saying in public for five years ago, as someone who’s endorsed prostitutes and strippers and that whole extreme of sex-positive experience, that I’m concerned about the effect on young people – people growing up from 8, 10, 14 in a climate where it’s gone to the opposite direction. I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism.`` Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of ``traditional`` values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a ``respectable`` face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.`",dev,False

But now I'll give you an example of why you shouldn't lend weight to them either, I will also tell you why the results you have aren't at all reliable. Using the search term ``female genital cutting`` does not tell us the context of the result google finds. I'll give you an excellent example of this: I googled ``female genital cutting`` from 2010 to 2010, (link here:[]). I draw your attention to the 3rd result from the top (that is, the 3rd most relevant result that google could find across that entire year for that term), the title of this article is ``Sexual function in women with female genital mutilation``. Given that the title of this article clearly favours the term FGM, I opened the pdf that google links to in order to find how exactly the term ``female genital cutting`` was used in the article. This is the text I found on page 2 of that article: :::::::*``Worldwide, it is estimated that 100 to 140 million girls and women have undergone some form of FGM, and each year 2 million girls are thought to be at risk (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification is superior to terms used by the public or even some scholarly reviewed publications. The latter terms include female genital cutting, female circumcision, female Sunna circumcision, and Pharaonic circumcision.`` :::::::If the 3rd result on the first page of google scholar search is already a result which is refuting the use of the term FGC, then I submit to you that you can't rely on google scholar results (or ratios of results) as a method of determining whether FGC is replacing or augmenting the term FGM. Also note that the 4th result also uses FGM in the title, and that the 6th result is another which is refuting the use of the term. If stats are what matter, then I'll put that into numbers. 33% of the top results for the term ``female genital cutting`` for the year 2010 are refuting the use of the term female genital cutting. 20:52`",dev,False

22157,522699441,"`Is Ethylene Glycol a Synonym for Antifreeze? Update 2 My intent in editing out the extraneous information of ethylene glycol poisoning in the Antifreeze article is that many editors and visitors to the Article are of the impression that all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol. This is a misconception. Case in point? Look above at the comments made by Flyer22 and TechnoSymbiosis. 1. Note that they mention articles in which the poisonous chemical is the Article in question. 2. Lead, Mercury (element), Asbestos, Benzodiazepine, paracetamol. That is a list of six 5 chemical substances and asbestos, which is virtually a chemical species for the purposes of this discussion. 3. Note also that the article in question here is not about a specific chemical, rather it is about a wide range of substances including the poisonous and deadly methanol and ethylene glycol. The article isn't about a chemical species like mercury or lead. It is about liquids (plural) which have special properties in commerce and mechanics and discusses practical applications of chemicals. So when auto mechanics or airplane mechanics discuss antifreeze, or when chemists discuss it or talk about it, this poisoning aspect is a rare but useful part of the discussion. It is only when talking about this topic medically that the need arises to discuss the many symptoms and embark upon long-winded treatises on what happens internally to a person intoxicated on a particular antifreeze. In commercial, practical, and chemical discussions, the fact that something is toxic arises obtusely to the main concern. Take those ethylene glycol warnings to the Ethylene glycol page and (if there was any sudden interest in it) to the Methanol article, which would be consistent with the 6 examples listed above. As a sideline, why aren't there any warnings of the deadliness of methanol, which is soooooo poisonous that it takes 10 mL of it to blind a person, and 30 mL to kill. Sounds pretty notable by the above standards, so let's list all of the symptoms in the antifreeze article, too. Or not. That would be borderline absurd, since the ethylene glycol lobby dictates that ethylene glycol is synonymous with Antifreeze. Another absurd corollary would be to go to the Thermal insulation page and discuss how poisonous Asbestos is. I mean, all insulation is asbestos, right? To summarize, this argument is about the scope of Antifreeze. I don't think this scope encompasses the symptoms of poisoning (from a particular type of antifreeze) which happen to be so difficult to spot that they deserve the full attention available at the Good Article named Ethylene glycol poisoning where all of the nuances of medical research and diagnosis can be discussed at length. : So fix the misconception, don't just blank an entire section. : Most antifreeze is still ethylene glycol. It's hardly an obscure risk. :No one is or has stated that ``ethylene glycol is a synonym for antifreeze.`` And the misconception that ``all antifreeze is ethylene gylcol`` can also be mentioned in the aforementioned section, although I have not read anyone in the discussions about this on this talk page express any misconception (especially since you've expressd such concerns before). Somehow, you are completely missing the point about why you are wrong to repeatedly remove this information. The point is that ethylene glycol poisoning, which is a part of this article, causes these symtoms; and therefore, there should be an appropriate summary of these symptoms, per WP:Summary style, before pointing readers to the article about it. It is not ``extraneous information.`` So once again, I will contact WP:MED to comment here on this issue. In the meantime, this information stays per the WP:Consensus against your repeated removal of it. `",dev,False

808,99386607,"Suggestions for Drishtipat In the interests of preventing the escalation of internecine conflict and ill-feeling between differing regional groups comprising the British Bangladeshi community, we hereby submit a list of requests for the administrators of Drishtipat London to implement. This should result in a more harmonious and co-operative environment in which DP London can hold conferences in Britain and continue it’s work in highlighting human rights abuses in Bangladesh and help make it a more effective organisation. Please signal your position regarding this communiqué. -The appointment of a British or Bangladeshi-born (Sylheti-speaking) Sylheti as executive of Drishtipat (DP) London. Thus accurately reflecting the overwhelmingly Sylheti character to the British Bangladeshi community and Sylheti concerns. -An official statement of regret on the DP website that thorough research of the composition of the British Bangladeshi community was not initially undertaken. This oversight resulting in DP London conducting their campaign of 2006 on behalf of Dhaka-based garments workers. A worthy cause but one better suited for a DP Chapter whose constituency is less monolithic in it’s regional and cultural composition than Britain. -Official confirmation that Faisal Ghazi (of Golmal blog fame) and Zubaer, DP members of ill-fame, have either been disciplined or preferably removed from DP’s campaigns. Their disparaging and outright racist remarks about British Sylheti’s on their blogs merits nothing less. -The celebration of the achievements of ALL diaspora Bangladeshis. Not selected members such as author Tahmima Anam, (under the guise of concern for human rights) whom certain DP members may know from their time in Dhaka.

I don't really see an urgent need to provide a citation for the fact that women can achieve organism from oral sex. On the other hand, surely such a source would be trivially easier to find. So ideally, we should just put a source in rather than deleting the tag. :In the case of the other 3 statements that are flagged as needing a source - these 3 statements are much weaker and really should be cited because as it is they smack of personal opinion and/or original research and/or contaminated by weasel words: :#Oral sex is often used as the principal form of sexual expression or as part of foreplay.

Pozdrav tebi i sve najbolje: Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this, that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called ``pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion to Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries. This is a typical way of overcoming any kind of ‘distaste’ in a human and civilized way, all the other ways are just a shame for humanity.

Of course, since Wikipedia is not paper, we could simply agree to have a content fork and let all three articles exist.

The fact that on the entirety of YouTube there is about 30 seconds of actual footage of Richard Kastle playing and a still shot of him on a Jay Leno show. Many of the so called 'trolls' that abuse Richard Kastle have a right to do so, due to the fact that a couple of psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time are truly wrong. There is also video footage on YouTube of a guy (who I believe is Kastle) discrediting major pianists such as Horowitz and Cziffra because they 'supposedly' simplified parts of their repertoire. This is completely NOT true due to the fact that University Professionals and other Professional Pianists would easily have picked up such a disregard for the music, in seconds. This article on Richard Kastle should be deleted due to the fact that it is just another excuse for one of those psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time, to brag about a man who does not deserve the credit he deserves.

The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see.

Switzerland is not required prior authorization and / or state recognition to provide training in settoreuniversitario, organize examinations or issue qualifications. There is the legal value of the securities. Federal or cantonal authorities, within their respective powers, ensure in cases provided by law on the activities of private universities. In Switzerland, except cases specially regulated by law, the judge of the quality and value ofa training is the user or the labor market before the state. In accordance with the tendenzeinternazionali, were introduced in Switzerland accreditation procedures optional (quality certification and / or quality marks) does not discriminate between public offering and private. Accreditation is voluntary and certifies only a external quality assurance and does not imply any recognition of the validity of Questa of that training by the state. The university sector in Switzerland is complex and consequent to the Eurosystem's federal country (A tertiary according classificazioneinternazionale): the federal government regulates and controls the Federal Institutes of Technology and the Universities of Applied Sciences (UAS) pubblicheo private. The cantons, according to the Federal Constitution of Switzerland, have sovereignty over the cantonal public universities and private ones operating in its territorio.In each canton then there are laws that govern the cantonal universities so different matter. The Confederation and the cantons have common skills regarding the coordination and development of quality, through the Swiss University Conference (CUS), joint body of university policy academic public. Nationally a Swiss national accreditation agency (OAQ), optionally accredits public universities and private chloro individual curricula, that gives them a quality mark, which however does not in itself confer any recognition and / or the validity of state titles conferred.

Regarding the value of the securities issued in Switzerland university academics: for the purposes of the exercise of a regulated profession (eg medicine, advocacy, etc.), are cantonal or federal laws regulating the profession that determine which titolisono recognized. For unregulated professions (eg, management, journalism, etc.) Is up to the fact aldatore work ``recognize`` whether or not the value of a degree; significant may be the accreditation or at least a quality certification issued by private entities generally recognized. For the purpose of further studies, is the university where you will continue its work that recognizes the value of a previous title. As is the case for equivalence of qualifications, universities are based on national standards. Private universities recognized to belong to the teaching system based in Switzerland, although not accredited (ie that did not require quality certification optional), however, have the constitutional right to grant university degrees who, without any difference from those issued by public universities, are valid for: the right of access for the purpose of continuation of studies in the university system (public) in Switzerland and abroad, in accordance with national laws and the Lisbon Convention of 1997, the Council of Europe on the mutual recognition of qualifications; for the exercise of regulated professions in Switzerland under the directive of the European Union CE / 2005/36 into force in Switzerland on 1 November 2011; for the purpose of Switzerland's non-regulated professions, that is the free assessment of the companyEquni (talk) `",dev,False

Vinterberg works against most of the negative traits here, favouring a loose naturalism within the highly stylised story and setting. :The acting is uniformly excellent, but the debate and almost all 'criticism' for the film is centered on the supposed moral of the story - a group of misfit and rather anodyne teenagers form a pacifist gun club, develop close almost fetishistic attachments to their weapons, and run into the inevitable conflict with reality. :NO SPOILERS. Reading reviews and press reports, almost all discussion (and dislike) surrounding the film has been of two types: a) a non-cinematic debate about gun control in the USA; and b) criticism of the film's artificial and 'inauthentic' setting.

There are unusual moments of beauty and life within the film, and if at times the temptation to view it as a somewhat 'failed' Hollywood drama intrude, nevertheless, as a film, it does not fall into many of the dull traps of those 'typical' genre films. :Much closer to van Sant's 'Elephant' than to (say) 'Bonnie and Clyde', and very much worth the time.",dev,False

Part of this course was an update of a Wikipedia entry of our choice. Below you can find the modified entry. I am happy about all kinds of feedback and comment. - Lupinus mutabilis is a species of lupines grown in the Andes, mainly for its edible bean. Vernacular names include tarwi, tarhui, chocho, altramuz, Andean lupin, South American lupin, Peruvian field lupin, or pearl lupin.Lost crops of the Incas: little-known plants of the Andes with promise for worldwide cultivation / report of an ad hoc panel of the Advisory Committee on Technology Innovation, Board on Science and Technology for International Development, National Research Council. - Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press, 1989, page 180-189. There are different aspects why L. mutabilis could become an important international crop. But until now, the high content of alkaloids in the seed is the main reason, why the crop is not very known outside the Andes. This content could be decreased by different processes. Origin and Dissemination The origin of L. mutabilis has been identified in the Andean region of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.Neglected crops: 1492 from a different perspective / ed. by J. E. Hernández Bermejo and J. León; publ. in collab. with the Botanical Garden of Córdoba (Spain) as part of the Etnobotánica 92 Programme (Andalusia, 1992). - Rome Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 1994. In this area, the greatest genetic variability in the world was found.The plant has been domesticated for more than 1500 years, mostly because of its high protein content. Biology L. mutabilis is an annual plant. The steam is hollow and highly branched. Plant height reaches from 0.5 to 2.80 meters, depending on the environmental conditions and the genomic properties. Due to the high vegetative growth, species from northern South America are taller than species from the southern Andean region. El cultivo y la utilización del tarwi: Lupinus mutabilis sweet / por Rainer Gross. - Roma: Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentación, 1982. The genome contains 2n = 48 chromosomes and there is a high genomic variation, which leads to big differences in morphology. Several architectural types of L. mutabilis exist. Most common is the branching in V-form, this type has the highest biomass production. The basal branching type has the positive feature that its infructescence is at the same level. This species is preferably promoted because of its early ripening, stability and the homogeny seed quality. Morphology The fruit is a 5-12 cm long pod, depending on the amount of seed. One pod contains on average 2-3 seeds, but can have up to 9 seeds per pod. The thousand-seed weight (TSW) is around 200g. Leaves are palmate and have a typical appearance: one leave is divided in five to twelve leaflets, which have an oval or lanceolate form. The form is typical for Faboideaes. The corolla reaches 1-2 cm and contains five petals. Variation in coloration is high and reaches from white to purple. The white coloration is recessive to purple. L. mutabilis has a strong taproot reaching 3 m length. Like all Leguminosae secondary roots build nodules containing bacteria for nitrogen fixation. Development The growing cycle varies from 150 to 360 days, depending on the genotype, altitude and environmental conditions. Phenological phases are: emergence, first true leaf, formation of the raceme on the central stem, flowering, podding, pod ripening, and physiologica",dev,False

Because, it has so many mistakes that no publisher could have handled it. The photos are all false, and not a single picture was an evidence of the ‘Nanking Massacre.’ Not only that, her description about Japanese history is filled with absurd mistakes. For instance, she wrote that the Japanese military strength before the end of the Edo era (1603 -1867) had not exceeded the level of sword, bow and arrow (in fact, Japan was the biggest producer of guns in the world already in the 16th century). More than 100 such rudimentary mistakes were found in the book, and even if the book is published in Japan, no Japanese people could bear reading it. A left-wing publishing company tried to publish it with notes annotated by translator, but she refused it saying, “How impertinent.” Sad to say, the Americans trust such a book and are making movies.” Shoichi Watanabe, a professor emeritus of Jochi University, mentioned, “Before World War II, a false document called the Tanaka Memorial was made in China. This was a purported Japanese strategic planning document from 1927, in which Prime Minister Giichi Tanaka laid out for Emperor Hirohito a strategy to take over the world. The American President Roosevelt, senators and congressmen read this forgery, and believed the lie that Japan had a malicious intention to take over Asia and the world. That became a cause for the US-Japan war. It is said that after reading it, Roosevelt decided to defeat Japan entirely. Iris Chang’s ‘The Rape of Nanking’ is the same.

Ergo, 70 years of nations serving Babylon began in 609. Babylon replaced the Assyrian world power in 609. :As I keep telling you, your exegesis is fatuous for it obviates the context of 2 Chronicles 36:20,21; Jeremiah 25:12; Zechariah 1:12; Daniel 9:2; Zechariah 7:5 and Jeremiah 29:10, among others. Try again. Fringe Views? Please desist from changing articles to match the fringe views of Jehovah's Witnesses.

Thanks. :How is it fringe when they're based on accurate and reliable sources? Wikipedia is a place for truth not your noetical bigotry. ::Reliable sources indicate the widely accepted chronology of the period. They do not support the JW chronology. And you didn't even provide any sources. You will need to discuss at the article's Talk pages to reach a concensus, however there are no mainstream sources in support of your views. :::Agreed. I've reverted you again. ::::You are both misinformed. According to the Cyrus Cylinder, Cyrus conquered Babylon in October 539 B.C.E. Cyrus’ first regal year began in the spring of 538 B.C.E. This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E. or “the seventh month (Tishri)” as Ezra 3:1 says. ::::It is a simple matter of counting back 70 years which brings us to 607 BCE for Jerusalem’s destruction. Dates other than 607 BCE ignore the statements in Scripture that the land would be desolate for 70 years. (Daniel 9:1,2) :::::Looking at your other edits I'm concerned that you don't have any grasp yet of WP:NPOV. I've raised them at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Bible#Editor changes biblical dates, etc where I hope you will explain your edits. You are also failing to use WP:Edit summaries, which is sufficient reason for many people to revert you. ::::::Thank you for the reminder concerning the ``edit summaries`` field. :::::You said: This means that the Jews would be back in their homeland by October 537 B.C.E.. That is wrong. The JW conclusion that the Jews 'must' have returned the following year is entirely speculative. Josephus explicitly states that the temple foundations were laid in Cyrus second year, which means the Jews were back in his first year, which means Cyrus decree was made at the beginning of hist first year, and the Jews then had 6 months to make the 4-month journey back to Jerusalem. ::::::Argumentum assertio does not a valid substitute for actual evidence make. Try again. :::::You also said: It is a simple matter of counting back 70 years which brings us to 607 BCE for Jerusalem’s destruction. That is also wrong. Jeremiah 25:12 (NWT) states: ``“‘And it must occur that when seventy years have been fulfilled I shall call to account against the king of Babylon and against that nation``. The seventy years were a period during which all the nations served Babylon (Jeremiah 25:11). One of the nations listed as serving Babylon was the Medes (Jeremiah 25:25), but the Medes were not serving Babylon when the Median general Darius conquered Babylon in 539. After Babylon was conquered, the nations were serving Persia. The book of Daniel quite clearly identifies when Babylon's king was 'called to account' (Daniel 5:26-31). ::::::Your exegesis of Jeremiah 25:25 is shockingly sophistic. Verses 12-14 & 17-26 lists those who would suffer Jehovah God's judgment; 'drink from his cup of the wine of his rage.' (25:15,16) It most certainly does not assert what you mendaciously allege. As I've already explicated, the seventy years of desolation Jerusalem had to experience was precisely that. (2 Chronicles 36:20,21; Jeremiah 25:12; Zechariah 1:12; Daniel 9:2; Zechariah 7:5; Jeremiah 29:10) Nowhere is this figure presented as allegorical or figurative in any way, shape or form. Your whole argument, then, has no purchase whatsoever. :::::::I'm not going to reply to each of your errors here. Suffice to say, your religious opinions are not welcome in historical articles. ::::::::Your harassment is not welcome nor will it be tolerated. Consider yourself warned. :::::::::POV-pushing of your religious beliefs without any support from neutral sources is neither welcome nor tolerated. Unlike your 'warning', that's based on policy. ::::::::::And in what possible world do you think your atheistic bent is accepted as noetical integrity? Multiple editors on here have provided independent, verifiable evidence for 537 BCE as being the year in which the exiled Jews in Babylon were repatriated. No matter your illusions, all your petulant bleating cannot change established history. Aut disce aut discede. :::::::::::Your attempt at ad hominem is irrelevant. And there are in fact more than twice the number of results on Google books for searching on 538 instead of 537. Josephus indicates that the temple foundations were laid in Cyrus' second year (Against Apion, Book I, chapter 21), and Ezra 3:8 places that event in the 2nd month (Iyyar), corresponding with May of 537 BCE. Ezra 3:1 says that the Jews were ``in their cities`` in the 7th month (Tishri) of the year before, corresponding with October of 538 BCE. Various sources indicate either 538 or 537.

DESCENT of Flight 9525 is done in autopilot OFF mode, and data from Flightradar24 showed changing altitude from 38,000 feet to 100 feet are only side artifact that does not matter at all. Worst nowadays is how technically illiterate are people that do specific technical job. Of the competence of those people you count on when you traveling by plane every day. This is already frightening. ``Not sure about that ``100%``. But you're saying this analysis by Dieter Scholz was the source of his comments? Martinevans123 (talk) `` :I don't understand how someone will ask such question at all. :: 1. ``The cause and effect must be contiguous in space and time.`` 2. ``The cause must be prior to the effect.`` 3. ``There must be a constant union betwixt the cause and effect. 'Tis chiefly this quality, that constitutes the relation.`` Read carefully what I wrote. You even have no idea how many of the other things I've written may be also true and correct. You should not be surprised by surprise twist: ``Who is the killer and who is the victim``. None of you heard records from CVR yet and may be soon or never you don't hear It. If I were the parents of this boy and all blame my son that he is a terrorist - I would now go to the media and to require investigators to launch this record, not only to talk about it. How much more profitable for Lufthansa is to accuse yong boy instead MAIN PILOT, who may be the real suicide person with real message to Lufthansa before he die on CVR. The question is: What will Lufthansa lose if the truth is that one of its pilot commit suicide because of disagreement with the policy of the company - and at what cost Lufthansa will try to keep it secret?

I have made persistent efforts (most recent) toward rectifying this, but each time my edits have been reverted. Rationale for the removal included the view that I was adding original research and that my additions were not WP:LEDE compliant in that there was no mention of robots within the body of the article. For editors who strive to increase the quality of Wikipedia, it is clear to me that the most helpful action to take for these valid criticisms, instead of simply hitting the 'revert' button, is this: - Statement in lede is unsupported. Fix: Flag as needing a reference. (I found a great book with a single googling.) - Lede is discussing a topic that is not discussed in the article's body. Fix: Add a statement or two into the body. I realize that these approaches to fixes require putting in a little more effort, but that's the direction that leads to higher quality articles instead of preserving the gaping holes in them. Last point: If there's an edit instability regarding the quality of an article, it is clear to me that the best place to initiate a Talk discussion is on the article's Talk page and not any particular User's Talk page (ie: mine). This way other editors who care about the issue in question are not required to go hunting around in order to get up to speed on whatever disagreements had transpired.

I pointed out to user Dinesh Kannambadi about one portion of text mentioned in the article on the Western Chalukyas. The said portion is copied in here for your information and consideration as an admin: The overall effort by Somesvara IV to rebuild the Chalukya empire failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Somesvara IV into exile in Banavasi 1189. After the fall of the Chalukyas, the Seunas and Hoysalas continued warring over the Krishna River region in 1191, each inflicting a defeat on the other at various points in time.[44] This period saw the fall of two great empires, the Chalukyas of the western deccan and the Cholas of Tamilakam. On the ruins of these two empires were built the Kingdoms of their feudatories whose mutual antagonisms filled the annals of Deccan history for over a hundred years, the Pandyas taking control over some regions of the erstwhile Chola empire.[45] In the above passage, while it may be ok for giving info on kingdoms in western deccan or deccan whose mutual antagonisms filled history annals.... I feel that mentioning the demise of the Cholas (who did so in 1279/1285 AD) in the Chalukya page who got eclipsed in 1190 WHICH IS ALMOST 90 YEARS PRIOR TO THAT OF THE CHALUKYAS, is quite inappropriate. Mr.Kannambadi also mentions that the Chalukyas convincingly eclipsed the Cholas after the Cholas lost Vengi is quite untrue. This is because Vengi was lost by the Chalukyas to the Cholas themselves under Vikrama Chola for after winning Vengi in 1119 or 1118, Vikramaditya expired in 1125 or so and was followed by very weak successors and the Chalukya capital itself was lost for around 30 years from 1136-1140 (courtesy, Ancient India by K.A.N.Sastri, 1956 edition). So what does he mean there, by winning Vengi and keeping it for 6-8 years the Cholas were convincingly eclipsed by the Chalukyas... Does it mean that we are to believe that sustaining a victory for 6-8 years enables an empire to claim glory or feeling that their opponents were convincingly eclipsed. I know Kannambadi will also speak about jingoism and that Hoysalas too won Gangavadi from Cholas, but pls. remind him that the same was prior to the Chalukyas conquering Vengi. I am sure you will be very well acquainted with these facts in case you have in-depth knoweldge of Indian History especially that of South India. I will await for your (hopefully) impartial decision so that these pages are reopened and their quality further improved through placing of proper facts supported by evidences.",dev,False

To avoid this, please let's stop adding and re-inserting non-encyclopedic matter. This has been complained of for years (see the ``Redundant & trivial content`` section of this talk page), but the editor responsible (committing the same errors at numerous biographical articles on the Capetians and their spouses and in-laws, as well as the Lorraines, Savoys, Estes, Gonzagas, Habsburgs, Wittelsbachs and French ducal families) seldom engages in talk page or edit discussions, instead re-inserting deletions and moving the page while dismissing fact tags and edit summary objections. The problem persists in two forms: inappropriate style and inappropriate content. The content violates Wikipedia's exclusionary policy against genealogical minutiae and exposition of insignificant details. It consists of excess in: Speculation (assumptions about the ``feelings``, ``thoughts``, ``attractiveness`` or ``relationships`` of long-dead persons, presented as if factual or probable yet not cited from the person's diary, correspondence or quoted statements); Trivia (information unimportant to the historical significance of the topic); Redundancies (information that is repeated more than twice in the article or duplicates info that is/should be in a different article), Extranea (superfluous information, only tangentially related to the topic).

Theoretically, I totally agree with you. But, as you know, there is a trend toward the acceptance of International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board all over the world. For example, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recommends harmonization of national accounting standards with IAS and IFRS. Also, the European Union introduced the requirement that from 2005 onwards, all listed companies have to prepare their consolidated accounts in accordance with IAS and IFRS adopted for application within the European Community. Considering international developments and as a candidate country for full membership, Turkey has issued a communiqué involving all IAS and IFRS and began application of them from the beginning of 2005 (As you know, we began application of IAS 29 in 2003). In this regard, we can change over to real value accounting when there is a change in IAS/IFRS toward real value accounting or there is a trend toward real value accounting all over the world.`` `",dev,False

19099,73467487,"` Askolnick, thanks for the detailed reply. I'm going to respond with a comment about civil language first, and then go on to your arguments. I'm not picking on you at all, but I think that, given the frayed tempers here, we all need to try to be as polite as possible. So with that in mind, could I ask you to be a bit cautious about saying things like ``believers in ghosts and ghoulies, and other things-that-go-bump-in-the-night``? When you say things like that, you know you're going to irritate Davkal, and that just makes it more likely he'll respond in the same tone. We already know that's not going to get us anywhere. Word choices like ``snipe`` instead of ``criticize`` are also likely to inflame passions; or commenting that Josephson's mind has been turned to rock. This might not be uncivil in the letter of the policy, but I hope you'll agree that it is really rhetoric more than it is argument if we truly are going to be rational about this, we'll have to discount the tone and connotations of those terms anyway. I do understand that a negative term can serve as a compressed signal of a criticism that would take longer to spell out politely; concision is important, but (because of the history of these edits) politeness is at least as important. I will make similar comments, if appropriate, after posts by others, too, unless you all tell me I'm overdoing it. I'd encourage everyone to police each other for this kind of civility slip too if I find you and Karl suggesting politer wording to each other, I'll know we've crossed an important civility hurdle. It's a bit trickier for you two to correct Davkal's usage, and for him to correct yours, so please be very cautious (and polite!) if you try that. Let's back up and look at why we care about the term ``parapsychologist``. The two alternatives are ``advocate for paranormal beliefs `` and ``parapsychologist``. I think the value (to those who support Josephson) of the distinction is that the former term leaves open to the reader the possibility that Josephson is a full-time professional physicist who, in his private life, happens to believe in the paranormal. The latter term has the implication that parapsychology is Josephson's fulltime interest, which (in at least some readers' minds) will give him a little more authority. I think all your points above are well-taken; the FoP paper is more synthesis than research, after all. But the Mind-Matter Unit does seem to be Josephson's full time job. I know he can always be described as a physicist, because of his past work, but I can't see any evidence that he still does mainstream physics research. It appears that whatever he does on a daily basis is done under the aegis of the Mind-Matter Unit. I think, for the purposes of the general reader of this article, that calling him a parapsychologist is a bit closer to representing that state of affairs accurately than just saying he is an advocate of the paranormal. Some caveats: * if we can find another term that describes his work better than parapsychologist, we can use that instead * if we can find evidence of what actually goes on day-to-day in the Mind-Matter Unit, then that may change the description. For example, if a statement exists somewhere saying that the job of the Unit is for media education on possible scientific explanations for the paranormal, that would imply a description like ``advocate`` or ``media analyst`` or some such phrase. What do you think? And Davkal, Karl, I will check your talk pages if you decide to respond there. `",dev,False

If this article needs any attention or maintenance, it would be preferable if that could be done before its appearance on the Main Page. If you prefer that the article appear as TFA on a different date, or not at present, please ask . You can view the TFA blurb at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/July 11, 2014. If it needs tweaking, or if it needs rewording to match improvements to the article between now and its main page appearance, please edit it, following the instructions at Wikipedia:Today's featured article/requests/instructions. The blurb as it stands now is below: Babe Ruth (1895–1948) was an American baseball outfielder and pitcher who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1914 to 1935. Born in Baltimore, Ruth was sent at age seven to St. Mary's, a reformatory where he learned baseball skills. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play minor-league baseball for the Baltimore Orioles. He began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including 714 career home runs. In his fifteen years with the Yankees, Ruth helped them win seven American League pennants and four World Series championships. His big swing led to escalating home run totals that boosted baseball's popularity and made home runs a major factor in the sport. Ruth's unprecedented power and carousing lifestyle made him a larger-than-life figure in the ``Roaring Twenties``. One of the first five inductees into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in American culture, and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. You (and your talk-page stalkers) may also be interested to hear that there have been some changes at the TFA requests page recently. Nominators no longer need to calculate how many ``points`` an article has, the instructions have been simplified, and there's a new nomination system using templates based on those used for DYK suggestions. Please consider nominating another article, or commenting on an existing nomination, and leaving some feedback on your experience. Thank you. hi I saw your comment about the kidnapping and indoctrination of boys in Syria. I agree, that would be a good example of violence against men, if we have an article on it it could be added. There have been other atrocities in Syria as well - for example there has been a great deal of sexual violence perpetrated against both civilian men and women. See ``HRW quoted a man who said he had been held in the Political Security branch in Latakia in a cell with over 70 other people. He said young boys were treated worse than adults, brought back to the cell raped and with their fingernails pulled out. ``One boy came into the cell bleeding from behind. He couldn't walk. It was something they just did to the boys. We would cry for them,`` the man said.`` You said that this category is novelty item, so I'm interested in hearing more about your perspective (without further spamming the CFD page, they've probably heard enough from me).

Pound sterling Thanks for the explanation of the revert. Hadn't looked at the infobox page properly - although in my defence, I did look at the Bank of England statistics and noticed that the value of issued £50 is greater than the value of £5, which I thought must count for something! :It's ok. So is the bank's figure in £ or the number of notes? If it's in £, then you would need to divide 10 for £50 to be fair. What constitutes ``frequently`` and ``rarely`` is sometimes still a subject of debate, despite the fact that I've tried very hard to lay out a well defined criteria.

(球球PK) | ::Well, the number of notes £50 issued is far less than the number of £5 notes, but only about 8 to 9 times less, so the actual monetary amount of the £50 notes is slightly greater. I think the criteria are nicely defined and make a lot of sense, so I have no complaints. My only suggestion would be to use a different word that ``rarely`` in the infobox or to make the criteria more prominent to stop do-gooders like me making random edits ) More categories to review DRV, SFD, SFD.

The proponents of the higher numbers cite this quote in their support: * ``According to Roy Medvedev, Stalin's victims numbered forty million. Solzhenitsyn says the number is far greater-perhaps sixty million. The debate continues even now.`` From the book: Lenin's Tomb The Last Days of the Soviet Empire by DAVID REMNICK (p. 129). My question is. Are the numbers cited above (40-60 million dead) reasonable or do these numbers include Gulag prisoners who survived? I know that it is difficult to estimate the death toll, but what are the most authorative sources on this subject? Can you help me find a reasonable range for estimation and the best sources to support it? I appreciate your help. :Most mainstream western historians give a figure of 10-20 million; that is itself probably a considerable overestimate. Info box inaccuracies I think there something wrong with the infobox (the top one with the picture) and the succession boxes at the bottom. First the infobox says his term of office was from 1922-1953 (I assume we are talking about the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, here, so I added that in). But if we are talking about the office of General Secretary, how can we say Lenin was the successor, as Stalin was the first General Secretary? Also, I'm not as sure about this, but I believe all Soviet leaders following Stalin were known as ``First Secretaries``, so Malenkov doesn't technically work as a successor either, I don't think. Also, the successor box on the bottom for General Secretary is definitely wrong, as Stalin was the first and Lenin never held that position, he was the Chairman, and indeed granted Stalin his position. Didn't want to make changes without consensus. :The ``secretary`` position was that of the top boss of the Soviet Communist Party. There is no reason to play technicalities about a particular ``office`` with a specific title. The issue is pretty confusing and there is no reason to put these intricacies in an infobox. At the same time, I agree that the formal details about party leadership must be addressed more carefully in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union article. ::It's just that I assumed, with such specific info there, dealing with de facto leadership is tricky. Perhaps if the infobox said it was only leader, that would help. But that's not the common convention. For George Washington, to use an example of a first officeholder, we don't say preceded by George III, or whomever, just because that is the leader. Well... on second thought that's not the best example, because it's a different country. But what I'm trying to say there's got to be a better way to do it without implying that Stalin and his predecessor and his successor all held the same title. Modern opinion What about people's opinion of Stalin in modern Russia? It could be quite interesting. Certain segments of the population removed: :, and by providing certain segments of the population benefits so as to win their support or co-opt them into the regime. What the heck these ``certain segments`` are? If bureaucracy is in mind, then this is of no special note: at all times in every state a bureaucrat lives better than a peasant. Apart of these (with a special subclass of apparatchiks), there were no benefitted segments. Moscow Minor quibble, but shouldn't the article at least mention, and possibly elaborate on Stalin's decision to stay in Moscow as German forces approached in December of 1941? As I understand it, practically every government official evacuated, but Stalin was adamant in his decision to remain. Seems a significant enough event to include here. Deportation of Romanians I removed the following addition by an anon, about deportations of nationalities : Romanians (from Moldova), I have a very vague memories on the issue.

I have gone out of my way to provide detailed information on sources and where those sources can be located. In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious, but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians. Jdorney uses two main sources...CAIN and Lost Lives. CAIN is a ``estimation`` at best, and the US State Dept. Jane's Intelligence, British Human Rights Watch, the Council On Foreign Relations, and various books and articles...all take issue with CAIN's facts and figures. As for Lost Lives, I have the latest edition of that book, and Jdorney completey fabricates the figures. If one reads carefully from 1969-2005, they see the number given as 86, shown as the amount of UDA and UVF members killed by IRA and INLA units. 85% of that number are given credit soley to the IRA. I wonder if jdorney even has the book, since he misquotes it so often. Similar numbers I have provided as to the number and units of British and Irish killed by the IRA is similarly backed up by Lost Lives...if one actually takes the time to read it throughly.

10192,169896965,"* Sorry, but WP:NPOV states we should represent: :fairly and, as much as possible, without bias all significant views (that have been published by reliable sources). Now I am presuming that have read all the books cited in the bibliography, because I have - with one exception - Sybille Bedford's book which is out of print. She wrote it the year after the case without access even to the trial transcript - and was therefore unable to analyse the case properly. She was also hampered by liable laws - Adams sued 12 papers after the case, winning each, so she could not speculate and even imply his guilt. The other books were all published after Adams' death for this reason. One is by two journalists (Hallworth and Williams) and says Adams was guilty (they had access to the police at the time of the investigation). One is by the judge, Devlin, who said Adams was a 'mercenary mercy killer' - hence a serial killer under law since mercy killing is a crime. Hoskins' book (the author became a friend of Adams) says Adams wasn't a killer, just inept - but Hoskins never saw any evidence at all and just interviewed Adams. Surtees meanwhile sits on the fence: he interviewed Adams (he was a colleague) and various people who knew him, but saw no records. The only book that was written with access to the police records is Cullen's. It states unambiguously that the wealth of evidence shows Adams was a killer - and states that political interference made the prosecution pick a weak case (confirmed also by Hallworth and Williams), lose evidence, hand confidential papers to the defence (allegations made in Parliament), prosecute half-heartedly (a view agreed with by Devlin) and then drop a second indictment - an act the judge called an 'abuse of process'(Devlin's words). For this reason Cullen's book deserves more weight than the others. At 687 pages it is even as big as the others combined. It is not a breach of NPOV to rely on a book that had access to evidence that the others didn't. It is for these reasons, as the guideline demands, the most significant view. All the others are lesser for the described reasons. Please respond before I reinstate the category you object to.",dev,False

Your take on the the Heterosexualization article, an article I don't remember being involved in until now, would be beneficial and relevant, I believe.

I don't understand this ``Leave them to it`` attitude that has been going around lately. I mean, I understand it in cases such as yours, but it seems almost everyone here is doing it now (being lazy or otherwise disinterested) when editors genuinely need help to resolve issues at an article.

It'll take some time and it's quite tedious, but it can be done. I'm willing to help on that, so what do you think? I'm going out for a while, will be back in about 3 hours time.

1405,9308982,"Vic arious Liability An employer is vicariously liable for negligent acts or omissions by his employee in the course of employment whether or not such act or omission was specifically authorised by the employer. To avoid vicarious liability, an employer must demonstrate either that the employee was not negligent in that the employee was reasonably careful or that the employee was acting in his own right rather than on the employer's business. It can also be understood this way: When one person is liable for the negligent actions of another person, even though the first person was not directly responsible for the injury. For instance, a parent can be vicariously liable for the harmful acts of a child and an employer can be vicariously liable for the acts of a worker. This I find very interesting, thinking of whether a demarcation exist. When can one say that the Employer is exonerated from the employee's acts, especially if the employee used the resources provided by the Employer (Tools, Vehicles, Landed Property etc)?

13952,18064407,"Historical Works Of Isaac Asimov, a Historiographical Analysis I, Historian Stephen: “But you are telling me, Susan, that the ‘Society for Humanity’ is right; and that Mankind has lost its own say in its future.” Susan: “ It never had any, really. It was always at the mercy of economic and sociological forces it did not understand – at the whims of climate, and the fortunes of war. Now the Machines understand them; and no one can stop them as they are dealing with the Society, - having as they do, the greatest of weapons at their disposal, the absolute control of our economy.” Stephen: “How horrible!”[1] The author of this dialogue is Isaac Asimov. Similar references to the history of humanity are widely used in his literature works. The author is a well-known writer of future societies, not only in fiction but also as treatises of the ‘march of humanity’ into the future. Neither in his stories, nor in the historical essays of Asimov can one easily find references to great changes in a society through the works of great men, great ideas or greatness of an arbitrary institution. This paper will investigate the historiographical method and mode of historical writing of Isaac Asimov. The Writer: Seldom thought of as a scientist, less even as an essayist, and almost never as a historian. The famous author of some of the best-known science fiction literature... Hailed as a “Grand Master” in 1986 by the Science Fiction and Fantasy writers of America Inc., Isaac Asimov has produced over 470 books on a large variety of subjects[2]. Among his portrayals as a writer are, as listed by one of his publishers Houghton Mifflin Company, novelist, humorist, futurist, current world record holder in literary output etc. Yet, more importantly Asimov was a PhD holder in the field of chemistry, a professor in Boston University. More relevant still for the purpose of the present work is the historian persona that Asimov assumed numerous times.[3] Asimov was born in January 2, 1920 in Petrovichi, Russia to a Jewish family that emigrated to the United States. He grew up in Brooklyn and graduated from Columbia University in 1939, obtaining his PhD in the same establishment in 1948. He joined the faculty of Boston University thereafter, and remained associated to B.U., however not in a teaching capacity from 1958 on. He died in 1992, his death was later revealed to have been as a result of contracted HIV from a bypass surgery he received in 1983[4]. Despite the fact that there are various different elements to his character, Asimov was a writer first and foremost. His first publications were in the genre of science fiction, first of which was published in an issue of Amazing Stories magazine in March 1939. Asimov claims that writing had been “ . . . merely an amusement,” and that he had hoped for a few dollars to help pay his college tuition.[5] Furthermore, for the introduction of his one hundredth work, he professes that he had never planned anything at all in his writing career, and that his commercial success was an “incredulous relief.” As for his historical works he claims that they were “primarily intended for non-historians,” as his science books were primarily intended for non-scientists. He is not only an amateur that has deep interests in history, but also a science-fiction novelist, whose literature work is influenced by his knowledge of history. Asimov’s major works, the Foundation and Robot series to name a few, depict the future not through the wars and technological accomplishments of humanity but they portray the human societies of the future, with a dominant preconception of formation and function of the past societies. To name a specific case; he declares that the fictitious Galactic Empire that is in power in the Foundation Series were written with certain periods of the Roman history; “Justinian and Belisarus of the sixth century and a little bit Tiberius and Sejanus of the first century…” to be exact, in mind.[6] The Works: Isaac Asimov is interested in history not only out of personal curiosity, but he can also justify this curiosity in terms of his profession.

I think it important to note that the ``Pensioners`` name possibly three different Patriots as the killer of Walter Butler. I have posted on my website “www.fort-plank.com” a page with all of the known references to Walter Butler's death which can be readily found in PRIMARY SOURCE materials. I hate using secondary and tertiary sources for obvious reasons and am very pleased that “wikipedia.org” has dramatically increased its documentation requirements for its articles! Thank You! Please do not add original research or novel syntheses of previously published material to our articles as you apparently did to Walter Butler (Loyalist). Please cite a reliable source for all of your information. Thank you. Deconstructhis (talk) I must in all fairness ask what the problem is with “original research? Are you implying that original and authentic research is not appropriate for “Wikipedia”. There is way, way to much trash out there on the “internet” which cannot be, in any way, verified. My additions to the Butler page were not suppositions, rather eyewitness statements as to what really happened to Butler. Unfortunately, the webmaster of [URL] is a personal and friendly acquaintance of mine, but he, and many other historians have bought into the early undocumented histories of the Mohawk Valley, most of which I have spent the last twenty-five plus years trying to authenticate as at least seventeen of my own ancestors fought in the Mohawk Valley during the Revolution, and regurgitated their unbelievable and unverifiable “facts” as their own research. Please, do not misunderstand: I am not upset, get confused!!! I would really like to see all of the content of the Internet be so reliable that anyone could simply look it up on the web and then contact the repository of the original document, pay the appropriate fee for copying it, and then have their own private library of primary source documents. Hope this finds all well! P.S. The “copyrighted material” that I incorrectly posted in Wikipedia was an article entirely of my own production and which was copied from my master copies of the 100+ pages of primary source data on my “www.fort-plank.com” site.

Googling for ``仁徳大君`` yields exactly one hit, which in and of itself seems to be a Goofle, as it were the ``cache`` link fails out, and simply viewing the link itself shows no instances of 仁徳大君, with only one 大君 on the page at all, but in an entirely different context, talking indirectly about the Meiji emperor (where we see 明治天皇 but not 明治大君). Looking up the term 大君 in Shōgakukan's 1988 edition of the 国語大辞典 does list 「天皇の敬称」 as the first definition, and the 和英中辞典 第2版 of 1993 shows 大君 as His Majesty, both suggesting an indirect address rather than a title. Googling for ``仁徳天皇``+``大君`` yields around 245 hits, but 大君 is again not used as a title there are no instances of 仁徳大君 anywhere I can find. I know that the web in Japan is not as developed as it is here, but if the appellation 仁徳大君 were common, I'd expect to find at least one hit. : If you have some source showing this use, please clue me in here.

It does not necessarily need to be in form ``Nintoku Okimi``, some other form showing that title which is more correct than tenno, is also acceptable.

And regarding more correct, as you put it, it's important to specify in which context I assume here you mean that tennō was not the term that was used in [choose your title] Nintoku's lifetime, which makes perfect sense to me.

Proof of this exists in the fact that this word can be taken so blatantly out of definition, that persons are asking that it be banned from the English language.

18279,40916540,"` Purges in the Red Army The late 1930s saw the so-called ``Purges of the Red Army cadres``, occurring against the historical background of the Great Purge. The Purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of the ``politically unreliable element``, mainly among the higher-ranking officers. This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for settling personal vendettas and eventually resulted in a witch hunt. Some observers believe that the Purges weakened the Red Army considerably, but this remains a hotly debated subject. Many commentators overlook the fact that the Red Army grew significantly in numbers during the peak of the Purges. In 1937, the Red Army numbered around 1.3 million, and it grew to almost three times that number by June 1941. This necessitated quick promotion of junior officers, often despite their lack of experience or training, with obvious grave implications. In another important consideration, by the end of the Purges the pendulum swung back, restoring and promoting many of the purged officers. Recently declassified data indicate that in 1937, during the culmination of the Purges, the Red Army had 114,300 officers, of whom 11,034 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940. Yet, in 1938, the Red Army had 179,000 officers (56% more compared to 1937), of whom a further 6,742 suffered repression and did not gain rehabilitation until 1940 In the highest echelons of the Red Army the Purges removed 3 of 5 marshals, 13 of 15 army generals, 8 of 9 admirals, 50 of 57 army corps generals, 154 out of 186 division generals, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.

Your email You have no right to do that. Firstly, I'm not Antony, secondly, I don't even like the guy, thirdly, its all true. What right do you have to just assume something is made up? I don't go around flagging other peoples work when I feel they are either misled or ignorant on a subject. How about you take your Cambridge degree and stuff it up your arse. Starting from your first point - I have utter right to do that. Every time you edit a page, you put your contributions under the GFDL; underneath the edit box is a note, in bold, as follows: Please note: *If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it. The page on Antony Phillips, whether or not it was you, was non-encyclopaedic. If you're not Antony and don't like him, then why are you putting up an article that lights up his antics? Why was that the only subject of your interest at Wikipedia? Why are you defending the deletion of that page at all? The page was utterly full of positive spin; many of the links that attested to his notability were redlinks (``Full Metal Blazer``? The entire thing sounds like a spoof, for drama class at school. That is NOT worthy of inclusion in a worldwide encyclopaedia; the phrase gets one single (myspace) hit on Google. That is nowhere near famous. That's so antifamous it's pathetic), and his current notability was listed as ``famous simply for being famous``. That is utter and total bullcrap. I assumed it was made up because of the way the page attempted to portray the subject as famous; while the subject of the article is an unfamous schoolboy. Whether or not it's true isn't even relevant; the page simply isn't notable. The subject of the article is not worthy of having an encyclopedia article. If you're not Antony, you shouldn't even care. Note also that I flagged the article for deletion - I didn't flag it for speedy deletion, I put it to the vote of the Wikipedia community. You didn't get any supporting votes; an admin then speedy deleted the article because it had no support. Wikipedia is used as a reference site by many schools, and combining that with the fact that a lot of you are bored/mischievous/etc, we get pages and pages and pages of crap. So much that guideline pages are written about it. When an article is about a student, and contains no notability other than assured notability within that school, then it is not going to survive. Whether it's me or someone else that flags it first, it's going to go. If you believe that the article should be reinstated, then go and contest it. Cite your sources. Add references. Make it sound remotely believable rather than made up. Then it might survive nomination for deletion. Better yet, find something else and make it better, like you did with the Abbey Road article. That'd be welcome. Especially - take note! - those where you can go around flagging other peoples work when you feel they are wrong. Make it right yourself - or flag it so someone else can correct it if you're not sure. The template is good for this if you know something's wrong with a page but aren't sure how to fix it yourself. This is an encyclopedia that strives to be correct - if something is wrong, why leave it wrong? As for the last, I'll point you to the first paragraph in my reply . That was someone else who didn't like their article deleted; they went on an edit rampage, vandalising pages, insulting people, and generally being a pain. Thank you for at least being more restrained than that - but my achievements there are national and international, sporting and charitable and academic and active. That list far exceeds the contributions of Antony Phillips, and yet I still don't believe that's notable enough to warrant an article. Everyone does things. However there are 6 billion people in the world. There's 65 million in the UK. Why does Wikipedia have only barely over a million articles? Because it only contains people who are actually famous - not every person who's been in a drama production at school. I suggest you have a little think about my reasoning; I'm fairly sure you'll still take this personally, but I'm one of those who assumes good faith. If you're still up in arms about an article that you claim isn't even about yourself, then to be honest I'd be quite worried about your mental health. If it was about yourself and you just wanted to be seen as being objective - then please bear in mind what this project is about, and I hope you can come around to improving it. Your second email Ok, I didn't want to resort to this. You are a cock. Good day to you. #Congratulations for effectively proving that you are Antony Phillips, confirming that the page was indeed vanity and so listed correctly for deletion. #WP:NPA #Please use the that is provided for every user, rather than resorting to emails for trivial matters. #Bite me, schoolboy.

19807,164643893,"`After reading the info on Rex Humbard, I noticed not ONE SINGLE WORD that would indicate he was anything but a wonderful minister. Many people, including me, would loudly disagree. In the 1980's, I personally interviewed a former worker in his computer center in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, and heard about the highly questionable fund-raising methods employed. That former worker told me that Humbard used ``scare tactics`` to get viewers, especially elderly viewers, to send in money. The main ploy was to send out many mass mailings and claim that his program would go off the air unless the viewers sent in a lot of money. The former computer center employee told me that Humbard told viewers in these mass mailings that ``the government`` was trying to shut him down. Also, the former employee told me that the Canadian government was so concerned about the mailings and calls to elderly viewers in Canada that Humbard was banned from mailing any promotion materials to Canada. Humbard's computer system was state-of-the-art, as was his TV studio equipment. An IBM engineer told me that Humbard had the newest and one of the best IBM mainframe computer systems in Ohio. A former engineer at WJW TV 8 in Cleveland told me that Humbard had, at least for a few years, the most expensive and sophisticated television production equipment in the Cleveland area. Again, according to that WJW engineer, Humbard's set-up was as good or better than any of the TV stations in Cleveland. My father told me how he would drive from Canton to attend services at the Cathedral of Tomorrow. He said that an offering would be taken and Humbard would ask people who came the farthest to donate the most. He told me that there was a massive cross that hung from the ceiling and that it changed color. Also, he said that the ceiling looked like the ceiling in a planetarium. The revolving restaurant idea stirred a lot of controversy. The concrete tower to support the restaurant was over 400 feet tall and the FAA was against the construction due to airline flight paths into Hopkins International airport. Cuyahoga Falls is fairly close to the airport. SEE: [URL] for a picture of the tower. Humbard's problems with the I.R.S. included running the Cathedral Buffet restaurant as a Not-For-Profit, even though it obviously wasn't. Ditto the trouble Humbard got into with the women's underwear factory he bought in Indiana. Humbard sold the Cathedral of Tomorrow to Ernest Angley Ministries and that operation has also had a lot of controversy. I hope others with information about these ``televangelists`` will post their comments.`",dev,False

You ``convention`` you mention that contradicts this is nothing more than ignorance you wish to dress up as something more. Tell me, Andrew Alder (church drummer and rhythm guitarist who has never in his life played an actual ``ten-string guitar``), if you notate music for a coursed instrument, do you write 12 or 10 separate lines in tablature? NO. You write one per course, which is in practical musical effect one string. If you write it in musical notation (can you even read this???

The outcome is directly related to psychosocial factors, including past and current psychological distress and work status or disability issues. As with any chronic illness, patients in the community do better than those observed in specialty clinics. Ten percent to 30% of patients describe being work impaired from FM. Physicians should discourage inactivity and disability because, if these are prolonged, there is an adverse effect on prognosis. Finally, patients have found a diagnostic label to be reassuring, and the diagnosis has decreased costly testing and health care use. ... :::Emphasis added.",dev,False

These references were removed by and . Notwithstanding my belief that GNU C-Graph meets the WP:Notability criteria, pointed out ``external links aren't required to be WP notable, just relevant``. Most reasonable people would agree that removing the reference to the only software that easily demonstrates the convolution theorem would be a disservice to the public. The text of the references reads: Under Convolution#External_links: *GNU C-Graph, a free software package for visualizing the convolution theorem, and displaying signals with their spectral plots. Under Convolution_theorem#Additional_resources: *GNU C-Graph, a free software package for demonstrating the convolution theorem, and displaying signals with their spectral plots. No doubt some WP:AGF administrator will recognise the educational value and reinstate the references for the benefit of the public. :Visionat, the places for these discussions are Talk:Convolution theorem and Talk:Convolution, not your own talk page. Those pages are also where you should have suggested the addition of links to the software you have written, bearing in mind WP:COI: to avoid any interpretation that you are promoting your own software, you should suggest the addition of the links on the talk page and allow independent editors (not necessarily administrators) to decide whether the links are an asset to the articles. If you look at WP:COIU, you will see that an editor with a possible conflict of interest may ``make edits where there is clear consensus on the talk page (though it is better to let someone else do it)``. That's the way to go. It's nothing personal, so your talk page is not the place for the discussion. I hope that helps. `",dev,False

I did not expect anyone to respond so quickly. My error. Since your contribution, I'll forgo editing and start anew to prevent confusion. You hit upon my major editing intent - to talk a bit about the blurred lines between categories. For instance, late Berlin is as easily categorized as House as New Music. In the case of Depeche Mode, they actually announced their intent to head into the club scene - thus we know it was a conscious decision. But as for the others such as The Cars, they simply progressed into a more mainstream sound over time. We actually agree on the major points you made. However, in my mind, there was more or less a definition of the genre that one could use at that particular time. For instance, in 1981 through 1983 the popular band Duran Duran was clearly New Wave. But I considered Sly Fox and Haircut 100 as also New Wave even though they were completely different. This despite the fact that I was not cognizent of what was on the producers minds at the time - we had no real internet with which to easily look up such things. The fact that the producers and I both agree on what was clearly the New Wave sound would be an astounding coincidence if it were just coincidence. But it is not coincidence - there was a definite sound to it, no matter how difficult it may be to clearly define it. Many of the bands attributed to New Wave were equally considered Punk or Pop. The Cars' first three albums could be considered both Pop and New Wave, but their Heartbeat City and subsequent albums saw them move away from the New Wave sound, or at least as I defined it circa 1981 when the genre hit it's stride (so to speak). We cannot define where the the edge of one genre ends and another picks up, but perhaps we can define the quintessential center of a genre at a particular time; knowing that the center will drift is some direction from year to year. Consider, my own preferences tended to drift towards the Pop side of the New Wave spectrum while someone else's preferences may drift towards the Punk or the Techo sides of New Wave. All the music could be considered part of the New Wave genre but all three of us could be listening to completely different bands. In a way, one could argue that New Wave put the three genre's together similarly to the way Fusion did with world music. Perhaps you are correct and I'm trying to define something that can never be clearly defined or agreed upon. As you can see, it being ``merely impossible`` did not stop me from trying, though.

Gildas does relate that the Britons called the Saxons to help them against the Scots and the Picts, but he deplores this act as foolish and outrageous, not as something normal.

It may be a modern sensibility to condemn invasions as such, but we aren't talking about condemnation. We are just talking about calling invasions with their proper name.

There is no valid excuse for removing that article and substituting the mess that is there now. Blocking me for real or imagined infractions is one thing. Destroying the article that I, and others, had worked long and hard on - and replacing it with an absolute piece of junk - is quite another. You have done extensive work on Wikipedia's Wyatt Earp article. How would you feel if all of your efforts were deleted? What was done to my last version of the Billy Kid article is nothing less than criminal - and that crime is against Wikipedia and all of those unselfish people who have tried to make it a reliable source. The joke is, I considered myself finished with the Billy the Kid article when it was suddenly removed. Now if you, and the others at Wikipedia ``sincerely value your expertise. Wikipedia needs knowledgeable authors like you,`` as you say. You will restore my last version of the article. Here is my good faith offer: If Wikipedia will restore that article at the point where I last left it, I promise that I will not go near it again. I look forward to the work that your expert editors can do to correct the ``encyclopedic tone,`` and encourage that effort. I also look forward to submissions and improvements to this article by other Wikipedians. Please note that I have claimed to ``own`` the Billy the Kid article. All I was trying to do was to provide the most accurate template on the subject of Billy the Kid that others could work from. The quickest way to do this is restore the article as it was when it was moved. I have no intention of trying to get it back to that point, by correcting the absolute mess that is up there right now. I trust you and all the forthright editors at Wikipedia to correct the ``encyclopedic tone`` that you consider lacking. I would also appreciate the removal of those tags that have suddenly appeared at the top of articles I contributed to on Bat Masterson and Luke Short. They suddenly appeared on the Masterson and Short articles at the exact same time my last version of Billy the Kid. It is not that I should be treated differently because of my credentials in the Wild West History field ... the fact is that no one should have to be treated that way.

Unless I am specifically asked for clarification, on some historical point on the Kid,by you, and others involved with Wikipedia, I have absolutely no intention of doing anything further on the subject of Billy the Kid.

6521,90903933,"` Atomic Attacks on Japan I'm not sure this section is a good example of revisionism. The reason is, the ``old`` view is still widely held and valid, the US certainly did drop the bomb to end the war quickly - it may have also had other motivations, which are now coming to light, which adds to a more nuanced picture of events. There will always be new perspectives and theories, just like in Decline of the Roman Empire, but these are not really revisionistic. Revisionism, strictly speaking, is where you take an established idea and discount it based on new evidence. Otherwise it is just the normal process of better understanding the many nuances and complexity of history. So I guess the question is, is there a school of thought saying the US did not drop the bomb because it wanted to end the war early? `",dev,False

I noticed the description page specifies that the media is being used under a claim of fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first non-free content criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed media could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this media is not replaceable, please: # Go to the media description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original replaceable fair use template. # On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all. Alternatively, you can also choose to replace this non-free media by finding freely licensed media of the same subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or similar) media under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself. If you have uploaded other non-free media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our non-free content criteria. You can find a list of description pages you have edited by clicking on [ this link].

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article. If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or ``db`` tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines. For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies.
